# Real-World Assets (RWAs)

## Definition

**Real-World Assets (RWAs)** refer to the process of tokenizing traditional, off-chain assets—such as real estate, corporate bonds, or revenue-sharing agreements—and representing them on the blockchain. This bridges the gap between the traditional financial economy and the DeFi ecosystem.

## Core Properties

### Asset Tokenization
- **Off-chain representation**: Traditional assets represented on blockchain
- **Fractional ownership**: Dividing high-value assets into smaller units
- **Global access**: Anyone can invest in previously inaccessible assets
- **Programmable logic**: Automated execution of complex financial rules
- **Composability**: Assets can be combined and used in various applications

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Legal frameworks**: Compliance with existing legal frameworks
- **Transfer restrictions**: Functions for controlling asset transfers
- **Allow-listing**: Address allow-listing for compliance
- **Asset freezing**: Ability to freeze assets for regulatory compliance
- **Permissioned access**: Controlled access to tokenized assets

## Beneficial Potentials

### Financial Inclusion
- **Global access**: Access to previously inaccessible assets
- **Fractional ownership**: Lower barriers to investment
- **Liquidity**: Increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets
- **Transparency**: Transparent ownership and transfer records
- **Efficiency**: More efficient asset management and transfer

### DeFi Integration
- **Collateral**: Use of real-world assets as DeFi collateral
- **Lending**: Lending against real-world assets
- **Trading**: Trading of tokenized real-world assets

### Economic and Social Challenges
- **Market manipulation**: Potential for market manipulation
- **Inequality**: May still favor those with more resources
- **Adoption barriers**: High barriers to adoption
- **Cultural resistance**: Resistance to new financial instruments
- **Education requirements**: Need for investor education

## Technical Implementation

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20**: Fungible tokens for divisible assets
- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible tokens for unique assets
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard for complex assets
- **Custom standards**: Specialized standards for specific asset types
- **Compliance functions**: Functions for regulatory compliance

### Key Components
- **Asset registry**: Registry of tokenized assets
- **Compliance mechanisms**: Mechanisms for regulatory compliance
- **Transfer controls**: Controls on asset transfers
- **Ownership tracking**: Tracking of asset ownership
- **Legal frameworks**: Integration with legal frameworks
