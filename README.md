## Core Concepts

### The Meta-Crisis
The meta-crisis represents a profound failure of civilizational coordination and adaptation, characterized by self-reinforcing feedback loops that accelerate existential risks while eroding our collective capacity to respond. It manifests through five interconnected systemic problems:

1. **Regulatory Capture** - Public agencies co-opted by private interests
2. **Misaligned Incentives** - Individual rationality leading to collective irrationality
3. **Disinformation via AI** - Erosion of shared reality through synthetic content
4. **Mass Surveillance** - Architecture of digital authoritarianism
5. **Economic Centralization** - Recursive accumulation of wealth and power

### The Third Attractor
The Third Attractor represents a narrow path forward that avoids both civilizational collapse (Chaos Attractor) and techno-fascist consolidation (Authoritarian Attractor). It is characterized by:

- **Agent-centric self-organization** - Individuals and communities have meaningful agency
- **Distributed coordination** - Polycentric governance structures
- **Life-affirming civilization** - Systems designed to enhance rather than extract from life

### Design Principles
The Third Attractor is guided by three foundational principles:

- **[[Vitality]]** - Holistic well-being and quality of life
- **[[Resilience]]** - Anti-fragile systems that can adapt to shock
- **[[Choice]]** - Sovereign agency and meaningful participation

### Web3 as Design Space
Web3 technologies offer unique affordances for the Third Attractor:

- **Coordination without capture** - Distributed consensus mechanisms
- **Privacy-preserving verification** - Zero-knowledge proofs
- **Programmable incentives** - Smart contracts encoding prosocial logic
- **Decentralized governance** - DAOs and distributed decision-making

## Usage

This wiki is designed to be:
- **Comprehensive** - Covering all major concepts and relationships
- **Interconnected** - Rich cross-references between related concepts
- **Accessible** - Clear definitions and explanations
- **Actionable** - Practical insights for implementation

Each entity page includes:
- **Definition** - Clear, concise explanation

## Contributing

This wiki is a living document that should be updated as new insights emerge and relationships are discovered. When adding new entities or concepts:

1. **Categorize appropriately** - Place in the correct directory (Research, Primitives, Patterns, or Capacities)
2. **Include cross-references** - Link to related concepts and source documents
3. **Maintain consistency** - Follow the established format and structure
4. **Update relationships** - Add new links to existing entities when relevant

## Key Insights

### The Meta-Crisis as Generator Function
The meta-crisis is not a collection of separate problems but a unified systemic dysfunction rooted in rivalrous, zero-sum worldviews encoded into our primary coordinating institutions. The five systemic problems are interconnected manifestations of this deeper dysfunction.

### Web3 as Enabler of Third Attractor
Web3 technologies offer unique affordances for addressing the meta-crisis, particularly through their ability to enable coordination without capture, preserve privacy while enabling verification, and encode prosocial rather than extractive logic into economic systems.

### The Importance of Design Principles
The principles of Vitality, Resilience, and Choice provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating whether interventions contribute to a fundamentally more adaptive, equitable, and life-affirming world or merely patch failing systems.

### The Role of Composability
Composability is not just a technical feature but a fundamental design principle that enables rapid innovation, network effects, and the emergence of new capabilities through the combination of existing primitives.

This wiki serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for understanding the intersection of Web3 technologies and the meta-crisis, providing both theoretical frameworks and practical insights for building a more life-affirming civilization.
