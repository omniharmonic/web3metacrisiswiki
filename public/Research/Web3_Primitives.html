<p>The term “Web3” describes a new iteration of the World Wide Web built upon concepts of decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.1 Coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, this vision aims to shift the internet’s paradigm from a model dominated by centralized platforms (Web2) to one that empowers users with greater ownership over their data, assets, and digital identity.1 At the heart of this transformation lies a set of fundamental, reusable, and composable components known as “Web3 primitives.”</p>

<p>A Web3 primitive can be defined as a fundamental, reusable, and composable component—be it a protocol, a cryptographic method, a standard, or a mechanism—that serves as a building block for more complex applications and systems within the decentralized ecosystem.3 These primitives are the foundational “Lego bricks” of Web3, enabling permissionless innovation by providing developers with a shared, open-source toolkit.5 The concept is broad, encompassing not only core technologies like smart contracts and decentralized storage networks 7 but also novel consensus mechanisms 9, financial building blocks such as those found in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) 5, and even abstract concepts like user-owned social identity and algorithmically embedded fairness.3 Tokens, both fungible and non-fungible, are considered a new digital primitive that grants users property rights over pieces of the internet, a feature largely absent in Web2.4</p>
<h3 id="the-meta-primitive-of-composability"><strong>The Meta-Primitive of Composability</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#the-meta-primitive-of-composability" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>The chief organizing principle of the Web3 stack, and arguably its most powerful feature, is composability. This is the inherent quality that allows disparate primitives to interact, combine, and build upon one another seamlessly, creating a whole that is significantly greater than the sum of its parts.4 In a composable architecture, every component is modular, autonomous, and discoverable, allowing developers to assemble them into new products with varying functions.11 This “money legos” effect is the primary driver of the rapid, exponential innovation seen in areas like DeFi, where complex financial products are constructed by stacking simpler primitives.5</p>
<p>This composability is more than a technical feature; it functions as a powerful economic flywheel that accelerates development at a rate impossible in the closed, proprietary ecosystems of Web2. The process begins when a new primitive, such as a decentralized lending protocol, is created and deployed on an open blockchain. Because its code is open and its functions are standardized, other developers can immediately begin building on top of it without seeking permission, for instance, by creating a yield aggregator that automatically moves funds to earn the best rates. This new layer of applications drives more usage, capital, and liquidity to the base primitive, making it more robust and useful. The enhanced utility and liquidity of the base primitive, in turn, make it an even more attractive and stable foundation for further innovation. This virtuous cycle, where primitives not only allow for code reuse but also for the reuse and compounding of capital and liquidity, creates powerful network effects that propagate across the entire ecosystem, fueling a permissionless and accelerating pace of development.</p>

<p>This report provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the essential primitives that constitute the Ethereum and broader Web3 ecosystem. It is structured hierarchically, beginning with the most fundamental components and building upwards to more complex and application-specific layers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part I: The Foundational Layer</strong> examines the core protocol-level primitives of Ethereum, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), smart contracts, and the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, which together create the secure, programmable environment for everything that follows.</li>
<li><strong>Part II: The Cryptographic Layer</strong> explores advanced cryptographic methods, particularly Zero-Knowledge Proofs and the Layer 2 scaling solutions they enable, which are becoming critical for privacy and scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Part III: The Asset Layer</strong> details the standardized token formats—ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155—that define how digital assets are created, owned, and transferred on-chain.</li>
<li><strong>Part IV: The DeFi Layer</strong> deconstructs the core mechanisms of Decentralized Finance, including Automated Market Makers, lending protocols, and flash loans, which leverage the underlying primitives to create an open financial system.</li>
<li><strong>Part V: The Organizational Layer</strong> analyzes the structures and mechanisms for decentralized governance and collaboration, focusing on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and their associated voting systems.</li>
<li><strong>Part VI: The Infrastructure Layer</strong> covers the essential services that connect blockchains to external data, make on-chain data usable, and enable a more robust and interconnected ecosystem, including oracles, decentralized storage, and indexing protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>By dissecting the ecosystem into these distinct yet interconnected layers, this report aims to provide a clear, analytical, and deep understanding of the building blocks that are shaping the future of a decentralized internet.</p>

<p>The foundational layer comprises the non-negotiable components that form the bedrock of the Ethereum protocol. These primitives create the secure, deterministic, and programmable environment in which all other applications and higher-level primitives operate. They are the fundamental rules and machinery of the decentralized “world computer”.13</p>

<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computational engine at the heart of the Ethereum protocol.14 It is a global, decentralized computer that executes smart contracts and manages the state of the Ethereum blockchain.14 The EVM is a sandboxed environment, meaning the code it runs is completely isolated from the host machine’s network or filesystem, which is crucial for security.17</p>
<p>Architecturally, the EVM is a quasi-Turing-complete state machine.14 “Turing-complete” signifies its ability to run any program, given enough resources.15 The “quasi” qualifier is critical: all execution processes are finite, limited by a computational cost mechanism known as “gas”.14 This prevents infinite loops and denial-of-service attacks, making the execution of untrusted code safe for the network.20 The EVM operates on a stack-based architecture with three distinct data components: a volatile</p>
<p>memory, a permanent storage that is part of the Ethereum state, and the stack for computations.14 Developers typically write smart contracts in high-level languages like Solidity or Vyper, which are then compiled into low-level machine instructions called bytecode. The EVM processes this bytecode using a set of instructions known as Opcodes.14</p>
<p>The core purpose of the EVM is to compute valid state transitions from one block to the next. This is formally described by the Ethereum state transition function: Y(S,T)=S′.14 In this function,</p>
<p>S represents the current valid state of the blockchain, T is a set of new valid transactions, and S′ is the resulting new valid state. Every time a transaction is executed, the EVM processes this function to update the global state, which includes all account balances and smart contract data.14 This capability is what elevates Ethereum from a simple distributed ledger for value transfer, like Bitcoin, to a programmable “world computer” capable of supporting complex decentralized applications (dApps).13</p>
<p>The significance of the EVM extends far beyond Ethereum itself. It has become the de facto industry standard for smart contract execution. The proliferation of “EVM-compatible” Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains—such as Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and Avalanche—is a testament to its immense network effects.14 This standardization fosters a high degree of interoperability and composability, allowing developers to port their dApps across numerous chains with minimal changes, thereby creating a vast, interconnected ecosystem of smart contract-enabled platforms.14</p>

<p>Smart contracts are the primitive that enables programmability on the blockchain. They are self-executing computer programs where the terms of an agreement between parties are written directly into lines of code.8 Stored and replicated on the blockchain, these contracts automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met, following simple “if/when…then…” logic.8 For example, a smart contract could be programmed to automatically release funds to a seller once a buyer confirms receipt of a product.24</p>
<p>By running on the blockchain, smart contracts inherit several key properties that make them powerful. They are immutable, meaning that once a contract is deployed, its code cannot be altered or tampered with by any party.18 They are also transparent and globally distributed; the contract’s code is publicly verifiable, and its execution is validated by every node in the decentralized network.18 This combination of features removes the need for trusted intermediaries like banks or legal systems to enforce agreements, allowing for secure, automated, and trustless transactions between anonymous parties.8</p>
<p>The deployment process begins with a developer writing the contract in a high-level language such as Solidity.18 This code is then compiled into EVM-readable bytecode. The developer deploys the contract by sending a transaction to the Ethereum network containing this bytecode. Upon successful validation, the contract is stored on the blockchain and assigned a unique, permanent address.18 From that point on, users can interact with the contract by sending transactions to its address, which triggers the execution of its functions within the EVM.13 Smart contracts form the foundational logic layer for nearly all higher-level Web3 primitives, including tokens, DAOs, and the entire suite of DeFi applications.23</p>

<p>The Ethereum protocol features two distinct types of accounts, which are fundamental to how users and programs interact with the network.29</p>
<p>First are <strong>Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)</strong>. These are the accounts controlled by users and are what people commonly refer to as a “wallet”.29 An EOA is defined and controlled by a cryptographic key pair: a public key and a private key.32 The public key generates the public address (e.g.,</p>
<p>0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045), which is used to receive funds and can be shared freely. The private key must be kept secret, as it is used to sign and authorize transactions, granting control over the account’s assets.29 The creation of an EOA key pair is a simple cryptographic process that happens off-chain and costs nothing.29 EOAs are the only account type that can initiate transactions, such as sending ETH or calling a function on a smart contract.29</p>
<p>Second are <strong>Contract Accounts (CAs)</strong>, also known as Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs). Unlike EOAs, these accounts do not have a private key. Instead, they are controlled by the EVM code—the smart contract—that is stored within them.29 A CA can perform any action an EOA can, such as sending and receiving ETH, but it can only act when it is triggered by a transaction sent from an EOA or another CA.29 Because they contain arbitrary logic, CAs can execute complex functions like creating tokens, implementing multi-signature security schemes, or running a decentralized exchange.29 Creating a CA requires deploying a smart contract to the blockchain, which is an on-chain transaction that costs gas.29</p>
<p>The key distinction lies in the source of control: private keys for EOAs versus code for CAs. This fundamental difference defines their roles in the ecosystem. An address can be identified as a CA if a eth_getCode call returns non-empty bytecode; otherwise, it is an EOA.29</p>

<p>Gas is a foundational economic primitive in Ethereum, serving as the unit of measurement for the computational work required to execute operations on the network.21 Every operation, from a simple ETH transfer to a complex smart contract interaction, has a fixed cost in gas units. The final transaction cost, known as the gas fee, is paid by the user in ETH to compensate the network’s validators for the computational resources they expend to process and validate the transaction.34</p>
<p>The gas mechanism serves two critical functions. First, it acts as an incentive for validators to secure the network. The fees they collect are a reward for their work in maintaining the blockchain’s integrity.34 Second, and equally important, it is a security mechanism that prevents network abuse. By attaching a real-world cost to every computational step, the gas system makes it prohibitively expensive for malicious actors to spam the network with transactions or execute infinite loops in smart contracts, thus protecting the EVM from being overwhelmed.20</p>
<p>Following the London network upgrade and the implementation of EIP-1559, the calculation of gas fees became more predictable. The total fee is determined by the formula: Gas Fee = Gas Units (Limit) * (Base Fee + Priority Fee).33</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas Limit:</strong> The maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction.21</li>
<li><strong>Base Fee:</strong> A mandatory fee, algorithmically determined by the network based on how full the previous block was relative to a target size. This fee is burned (destroyed) rather than paid to the validator, creating a deflationary pressure on the supply of ETH.36</li>
<li><strong>Priority Fee (Tip):</strong> An optional fee paid directly to the validator to incentivize them to include the transaction in the next block, especially during times of high network congestion.33</li>
</ul>
<p>This mechanism creates a dynamic fee market that responds to network demand while making costs more predictable for users.36</p>
<h3 id="15-the-consensus-mechanism-proof-of-stake-pos"><strong>1.5 The Consensus Mechanism: Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#15-the-consensus-mechanism-proof-of-stake-pos" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is the consensus mechanism that Ethereum uses to agree upon the state of the ledger and add new blocks to the chain.37 It replaced the prior, energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) system in an event known as “The Merge”.37 In a PoS system, network security is maintained through economic incentives rather than raw computational power.40</p>
<p>The mechanism works by having participants, known as validators, lock up a specific amount of the native cryptocurrency—32 ETH in Ethereum’s case—as collateral. This process is called “staking”.40 In return for staking their capital, validators are given the responsibility to participate in the consensus process. The protocol randomly selects validators to propose new blocks of transactions and forms committees of other validators to vote on (or “attest” to) the validity of these proposed blocks.37</p>
<p>Honest and active participation is rewarded with additional ETH, providing a return on the staked capital.41 Conversely, dishonest behavior, such as proposing multiple blocks in a single slot or submitting conflicting attestations, is severely punished. This penalty, known as “slashing,” involves the partial or total destruction of the validator’s staked 32 ETH.41 This “something of value…that can be destroyed” is the core security principle of PoS.41 It makes attacks on the network, such as a 51% attack, extraordinarily expensive, as an attacker would not only need to acquire a majority of all staked ETH but would also risk having that massive capital investment destroyed through slashing by the honest validators in the network.40 PoS is therefore considered a more energy-efficient and economically secure consensus primitive than its PoW predecessor.37</p>
<p>The primitives of this foundational layer are not independent components but rather form an interlocking system of cryptographic and economic security. The design elegantly balances programmability with safety. Smart contracts introduce the potential for complex, arbitrary computation on a global scale. However, this power brings the risk of unbounded or malicious code. The gas mechanism directly addresses this by attaching a tangible cost to every computational step, thereby making the quasi-Turing-complete EVM safe to operate and preventing it from being halted by infinite loops or spam attacks.</p>
<p>The fees generated by this gas mechanism are not merely a cost; they are the fuel for the network’s security engine. These fees create a direct economic incentive for validators to dedicate resources to processing transactions and securing the network. The Proof-of-Stake mechanism formalizes this relationship, requiring validators to post a significant capital bond (staked ETH) to participate. This stake acts as a powerful deterrent against dishonest behavior; any attempt to validate fraudulent transactions or attack the consensus process results in the validator’s capital being slashed. This creates a self-sustaining and self-securing loop: programmable logic is made safe by economic cost, which in turn funds the economic security that guarantees the integrity of the logic’s execution. An attack on any single part of this system is disincentivized by another part, demonstrating a holistic design where economic incentives are the connective tissue that binds the technical components into a robust, decentralized state machine.</p>

<p>A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a powerful cryptographic method that allows one party, the prover, to prove to another party, the verifier, that a given statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.43 This concept is built on three fundamental properties that every ZKP system must satisfy 44:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Completeness:</strong> If the statement is true, an honest prover will always be able to convince an honest verifier.</li>
<li><strong>Soundness:</strong> If the statement is false, a dishonest prover has a negligible probability of convincing an honest verifier that it is true.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> The verifier learns nothing from the interaction except for the fact that the statement is true. No secret information is leaked.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are various types of ZKPs, which can be broadly categorized as either interactive (requiring back-and-forth communication between prover and verifier) or non-interactive (where the proof is a single message that can be verified by anyone).43 Within the non-interactive category, two constructions have become particularly prominent in the blockchain space:</p>
<p><strong>zk-SNARKs</strong> (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and <strong>zk-STARKs</strong> (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge).44 zk-SNARKs are known for their small proof sizes, making them efficient to verify on-chain, while zk-STARKs do not require a trusted setup phase and are considered more resistant to quantum computing attacks.47</p>
<p>The applications of ZKPs as a Web3 primitive are vast and transformative. They are the cornerstone of privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like Zcash, which use them to shield transaction details.43 Beyond simple transactions, ZKPs enable verifiable computation, allowing for complex calculations to be performed off-chain with a succinct proof of correctness submitted on-chain. This is the basis for ZK-Rollups, a leading scalability solution.3 They are also a critical primitive for identity and authentication, enabling a user to prove they meet certain criteria (e.g., are over 18, have a certain credit score, or hold a specific NFT) without revealing the underlying sensitive data.44 Furthermore, ZKPs can be used to embed “fairness” directly into applications by enabling verifiable randomness or allowing players in a game to prove they followed the rules without revealing their hidden strategies.3</p>

<p>Rollups are a class of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions designed to increase transaction throughput and reduce costs on a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain like Ethereum.50 The core idea is to execute transactions off-chain, on the L2, but to post the transaction data back to the L1. By doing this, rollups inherit the security and data availability of the underlying L1 while offloading the computationally expensive task of transaction execution.52 They “roll up” hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single batch that is submitted to the mainnet, amortizing the L1 transaction fee across all users in the batch.51 Two primary types of rollups have emerged, distinguished by their method of ensuring the validity of off-chain transactions.</p>
<h4 id="221-optimistic-rollups-and-fraud-proofs"><strong>2.2.1 Optimistic Rollups and Fraud Proofs</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#221-optimistic-rollups-and-fraud-proofs" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h4>
<p>Optimistic Rollups operate on the principle of “innocent until proven guilty”.54 They</p>
<p><em>assume</em> that all transactions bundled in a batch and submitted to the L1 are valid by default—this is the “optimistic” assumption.56</p>
<p>The security of this model is maintained through a crypto-economic mechanism centered on <strong>fraud proofs</strong>. After a batch’s state root is posted to the L1, a “challenge period” begins, which typically lasts about seven days.54 During this window, any observer (a verifier) can challenge the validity of the batch by submitting a fraud proof to the L1 smart contract. A fraud proof is a claim that demonstrates a state transition within the batch was invalid.52 If the fraud proof is successful, the L1 contract reverts the fraudulent transaction and all subsequent transactions in the batch. The sequencer (the entity that created and submitted the batch) is penalized by having their staked bond slashed.52 This system relies on the assumption that there will always be at least one honest verifier monitoring the chain to challenge invalid states.56 Prominent examples of optimistic rollups include Arbitrum and Optimism.52</p>

<p>In contrast to the optimistic approach, ZK-Rollups operate on the principle of “guilty until proven innocent”.50 They proactively</p>
<p><em>prove</em> the validity of every transaction batch before its state is accepted on the L1.</p>
<p>The security model of ZK-Rollups is based on cryptography rather than economic incentives. Instead of a challenge period and fraud proofs, they utilize <strong>validity proofs</strong>.60 The sequencer processes a batch of transactions off-chain and uses ZKP technology (like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs) to generate a succinct cryptographic proof that attests to the integrity of every computation in that batch.61 This validity proof, along with the compressed transaction data, is submitted to a verifier smart contract on the L1. The L1 contract can verify the proof in milliseconds. If the proof is valid, the state update is accepted as final.61 This model provides mathematical guarantees of correctness, making fraud mathematically impossible rather than just economically irrational.61 Leading ZK-Rollup projects include zkSync and Starknet.47</p>

<p>The existence of these two distinct rollup types is a direct manifestation of the inherent trade-offs in blockchain design, often referred to as the scalability trilemma (decentralization, security, and scalability). Ethereum’s Layer 1 prioritizes decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, resulting in high fees and network congestion.55 Layer 2 solutions emerged to address this scalability bottleneck. However, the choice between Optimistic and ZK-Rollups reveals a further set of trade-offs within the L2 design space, primarily centered on the nature of trust, efficiency, and verification.</p>
<p>Optimistic Rollups make a pragmatic trade-off: they achieve high EVM compatibility and lower computational complexity by introducing a time delay (the challenge period) and a crypto-economic trust model. This model trusts that at least one honest actor will be monitoring the chain to detect and prove fraud.56 This approach was faster to market and generally easier for existing Ethereum applications to adopt.</p>
<p>ZK-Rollups make a different trade-off. They achieve faster finality and a higher degree of security based on mathematical certainty, but historically at the cost of greater computational complexity for proof generation and more difficulty in achieving full EVM compatibility.62 The technology is more advanced but has taken longer to mature. These two rollup types are not merely different technologies; they represent two points on a spectrum of trust and efficiency. The market is likely to see both coexist, with different applications selecting the model that best aligns with their specific requirements for finality speed, transaction cost, security guarantees, and development complexity.</p>

<p>The asset layer consists of standardized smart contract interfaces that define how digital assets are created, owned, and transferred on the Ethereum blockchain.

This standardization is a key enabler of composability.</p>

<p>The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment 20) standard is the technical blueprint for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum.64 Fungibility means that each unit of a token is identical to and interchangeable with every other unit, much like how one US dollar is equal in value to any other US dollar.65 This property makes ERC-20 tokens ideal for representing currencies, voting rights, or shares in a project.67</p>
<p>The standard mandates that a compliant smart contract must implement a specific set of six functions and two events.68 The core functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>totalSupply(): Returns the total number of tokens in circulation.</li>
<li>balanceOf(address owner): Returns the token balance of a specific address.</li>
<li>transfer(address to, uint256 value): Transfers a specified number of tokens to a recipient address.</li>
<li>approve(address spender, uint256 value): Allows a spender (e.g., a decentralized exchange) to withdraw up to a certain number of tokens from the owner’s account.</li>
<li>allowance(address owner, address spender): Checks the remaining number of tokens a spender is allowed to withdraw.</li>
<li>transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value): Used by a spender to execute an approved transfer on behalf of the owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The significance of the ERC-20 standard cannot be overstated. Before its adoption in 2017, tokens were created with unique interfaces, hindering their interaction with other applications.66 ERC-20 created a universal language for fungible tokens, ensuring that any wallet, exchange, or dApp could support any ERC-20 token without needing custom integration. This primitive unlocked the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom and laid the foundational groundwork for the entire DeFi ecosystem by enabling the seamless composability of tokenized assets.66</p>

<p>The ERC-721 standard provides the framework for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where each token is unique, has a distinct value, and is not interchangeable with any other token.70 This primitive allows for the on-chain representation of ownership for one-of-a-kind digital or physical assets, such as digital art, collectibles, event tickets, or real estate titles.71</p>
<p>Unlike ERC-20, which tracks the quantity of tokens an address holds, ERC-721 tracks the ownership of individual, unique tokens. Each ERC-721 token is identified by a unique tokenId.70 The core of the standard includes functions like</p>
<p>ownerOf(uint256 tokenId), which returns the address of the owner of a specific token, and safeTransferFrom, which handles the secure transfer of ownership.70</p>
<p>A critical feature of the ERC-721 standard is the tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) function.73 This function returns a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that points to a JSON file containing the token’s metadata. This metadata describes the unique properties of the asset, such as its name, description, image, and other attributes.70 This mechanism is what gives each NFT its distinct identity and value. The ERC-721 primitive was revolutionary because it established the concept of provable digital scarcity and ownership, creating the technical foundation for the multi-billion dollar digital art and collectibles markets.70</p>

<p>The ERC-1155 standard is a more advanced and efficient primitive that combines the features of both ERC-20 and ERC-721. It is a multi-token standard, meaning a single smart contract can manage an infinite number of different token types, which can be either fungible or non-fungible.75</p>
<p>The mechanism works by using a unique id to distinguish each token type within the contract. The contract tracks the balance of each id for each user address. If a token id is minted with a supply of one, it functions as a non-fungible token (like ERC-721). If it is minted with a supply greater than one, it functions as a fungible token (like ERC-20).76</p>
<p>The primary advantage of ERC-1155 is its efficiency, particularly in reducing transaction costs. The standard includes functions like safeBatchTransferFrom, which allows for the transfer of multiple different token types (e.g., sending 100 gold coins, one unique sword, and five magic potions) in a single, atomic transaction.75 This is a significant improvement over the older standards, which would require a separate transaction for each token transfer, incurring much higher gas fees.75 This efficiency makes ERC-1155 the ideal primitive for applications that manage a large variety of assets, such as blockchain-based games and NFT marketplaces.75</p>

<p>The asset layer continues to evolve with new primitives designed to bridge the on-chain and off-chain worlds and create new financial instruments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-World Assets (RWAs):</strong> This refers to the process of tokenizing traditional, off-chain assets—such as real estate, corporate bonds, or revenue-sharing agreements—and representing them on the blockchain.10 This is a significant development as it brings the vast value of the traditional financial economy into the DeFi ecosystem. However, it introduces new complexities and requires new primitives to handle regulatory and compliance requirements. For instance, RWA token standards often need to include functions for<br/>
isTransferAllowed, allow-listing addresses, and freezing assets to comply with legal frameworks, thus bridging the gap between permissionless DeFi and permissioned traditional finance.79</li>
<li><strong>Digital Domains (ENS):</strong> Systems like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) allow users to register human-readable names (e.g., example.eth) and link them to their Ethereum addresses.22 These names are themselves ERC-721 NFTs. This primitive is evolving beyond a simple naming service into a new class of financial primitive. Because they are programmable NFTs, ENS domains can be fractionalized into fungible tokens, leased out like digital real estate, or used as collateral for loans in DeFi protocols.5 This emerging field, sometimes termed “DomainFi,” merges digital identity with financial utility, turning a user’s on-chain name into a productive asset.5</li>
</ul>
<p>The evolution from simple fungible tokens to unique NFTs, hybrid multi-tokens, and now complex representations of real-world and identity-based assets showcases the power of a composable and open standards-based approach. The following table summarizes the key differences between the three primary token standards.</p>

<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in financial services, providing open, permissionless, and transparent alternatives to traditional systems.28 The DeFi layer is where foundational and asset primitives are combined to create a rich ecosystem of financial applications. These applications are built from a set of core, composable mechanisms that function as the financial primitives of Web3.</p>
<h3 id="41-automated-market-makers-amms-and-liquidity-pools"><strong>4.1 Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Liquidity Pools</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#41-automated-market-makers-amms-and-liquidity-pools" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a cornerstone primitive of DeFi, forming the basis for most decentralized exchanges (DEXs).81 Unlike traditional exchanges that use an order book to match individual buyers and sellers, AMMs use algorithms and pools of assets to facilitate trades automatically and permissionlessly.83</p>
<p>The core component of an AMM is the <strong>liquidity pool</strong>. This is a smart contract that holds reserves of two or more tokens, creating a trading pair (e.g., ETH/USDC).86 These pools are crowdsourced; users, known as</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity Providers (LPs)</strong>, can deposit an equivalent value of each token into the pool to provide liquidity.81 In return for their contribution, LPs receive</p>
<p><strong>LP tokens</strong>, which represent their proportional share of the pool. They are incentivized to provide liquidity by earning a share of the trading fees generated by the pool.81</p>
<p>The pricing mechanism for most AMMs, as pioneered by Uniswap, is governed by a <strong>constant product formula</strong>, expressed as x×y=k.83 In this formula,</p>
<p>x and y represent the quantities of the two tokens in the liquidity pool, and k is a constant. When a trader wants to swap one token for another, they trade directly with the pool. For example, to buy ETH with USDC, a trader adds USDC to the pool and removes ETH. This action changes the ratio of the tokens: the supply of ETH (x) decreases while the supply of USDC (y) increases. To maintain the constant k, the price of ETH relative to USDC must increase algorithmically.83 This elegant mechanism ensures that liquidity is always available, regardless of trade size, though larger trades will experience more “slippage” (a change in price).88 AMMs have democratized market-making, allowing anyone to become a liquidity provider and enabling permissionless token swaps 24/7.81</p>

<p>Decentralized lending and borrowing protocols, such as Aave and Compound, create autonomous money markets on the blockchain.28 These platforms allow users to lend their crypto assets to earn interest or borrow assets against collateral in a trustless manner.80</p>
<p>The mechanism is centered around liquidity pools for each asset. Lenders supply their tokens to a pool and, in return, receive interest-bearing tokens that represent their deposit (e.g., cTokens in Compound or aTokens in Aave).98 These tokens accrue interest in real-time as borrowers pay fees to the protocol. Borrowers, on the other hand, can take out loans from these pools but must first deposit collateral of a different asset.98</p>
<p>Several key primitives ensure the stability and security of these protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-collateralization:</strong> This is a crucial risk management primitive. To mitigate the risk of default in a volatile market, borrowers are required to lock up collateral that is worth significantly more than the value of their loan.97 For example, to borrow <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">80</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02691em;">w</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">or</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">ser</span><span class="mord mathnormal">mi</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ee</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">p</span><span class="mord mathnormal">os</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span></span></span></span>100 worth of ETH.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidation:</strong> If the value of a borrower’s collateral drops below a predetermined “liquidation threshold” (due to market price changes), their position becomes under-collateralized and is at risk. The protocol then allows third-party users, known as liquidators, to repay a portion of the borrower’s debt in exchange for being able to purchase the collateral at a discount. This automated process ensures that lenders are always made whole and the protocol remains solvent.97</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Interest Rates:</strong> Interest rates for both lending and borrowing are not fixed but are determined algorithmically. They dynamically adjust based on the supply and demand within each asset pool, measured by the “utilization rate” (the percentage of supplied assets that are currently being borrowed). High utilization leads to higher interest rates to incentivize more supply, while low utilization results in lower rates to encourage borrowing.97</li>
</ul>

<p>Yield farming is a meta-strategy built on top of other DeFi primitives, where users actively move their capital between different protocols to maximize their total returns, or “yield”.103 A yield farmer might, for example, supply assets to a lending protocol to earn interest, then use the interest-bearing tokens they receive as collateral to borrow another asset, which they then supply to a different liquidity pool to earn trading fees.104</p>
<p>A specific and highly influential form of yield farming is <strong>liquidity mining</strong>. This is a mechanism where a DeFi protocol incentivizes users to provide liquidity by rewarding them not only with the standard fees (from lending or trading) but also with an additional reward in the form of the protocol’s own native governance token.104</p>
<p>This primitive, popularized by Compound in the “DeFi Summer” of 2020, proved to be a powerful tool for bootstrapping new protocols.28 By distributing its governance token (COMP) to the earliest users who supplied and borrowed assets, Compound was able to rapidly attract a large amount of liquidity and simultaneously decentralize its governance, handing control over to its community of users.100 Liquidity mining created a powerful incentive for capital to flow throughout the DeFi ecosystem, accelerating its growth and innovation.104</p>
<h3 id="44-atomic-uncollateralized-lending-flash-loans"><strong>4.4 Atomic Uncollateralized Lending: Flash Loans</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#44-atomic-uncollateralized-lending-flash-loans" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Flash loans are a uniquely DeFi primitive that enables uncollateralized lending.108 They allow a user to borrow a vast amount of assets without providing any collateral, but with one strict condition: the loan must be borrowed and fully repaid within the exact same blockchain transaction.108</p>
<p>This seemingly impossible feat is made possible by the <strong>atomic nature</strong> of blockchain transactions. A transaction on Ethereum is an “all-or-nothing” operation. A smart contract can be programmed to execute a series of steps: 1) lend assets to the borrower, 2) allow the borrower to perform a set of actions with those assets, and 3) check if the loan (plus a small fee) has been returned. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the transaction’s execution, the smart contract simply reverts, and the entire transaction—including the initial loan—is cancelled as if it never occurred.109 This makes the loan completely risk-free for the lending protocol.</p>
<p>Flash loans are a powerful tool for developers and traders to perform capital-intensive operations that can be completed within a single transaction. Common use cases include 108:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arbitrage:</strong> A trader can borrow millions of dollars to exploit a price discrepancy for an asset between two different DEXs, buying low on one and selling high on the other, repaying the loan, and pocketing the difference, all in one atomic transaction.108</li>
<li><strong>Collateral Swaps:</strong> A user can instantly swap the collateral backing their loan in a lending protocol without having to first repay the loan.108</li>
<li><strong>Liquidations:</strong> Flash loans provide the necessary capital for liquidators to repay a borrower’s debt and claim the discounted collateral.110</li>
</ul>
<p>While the flash loan primitive itself is secure for lenders, it has also become a notorious tool for attackers. By providing temporary access to massive amounts of capital, flash loans enable malicious actors to manipulate markets or exploit economic vulnerabilities in other DeFi protocols, leading to what are known as “flash loan attacks”.108</p>
<p>The interplay of these DeFi primitives has created an environment that is both hyper-innovative and ruthlessly efficient. Open, programmable liquidity venues like AMMs and lending protocols form the base layer. On top of this, yield farming acts as a powerful force, directing capital to the most promising or highest-yielding protocols, creating a fierce and dynamic market for liquidity. Acting as both a catalyst for market efficiency and a system-wide stress test, flash loans complete the picture. They enable arbitrageurs to instantly correct price inefficiencies across disparate markets, enforcing a high degree of market rationality. Simultaneously, they arm attackers with the capital necessary to exploit any logical flaw, security vulnerability, or weak economic design in a protocol’s code.</p>
<p>This dynamic means that DeFi protocols are in a constant state of adversarial testing in a live environment. Protocols with insecure code or poorly designed economic models are quickly identified and exploited, often being drained of their capital via flash loan attacks. Conversely, protocols that are robust, secure, and efficient survive, thrive, and attract even more liquidity. This process establishes a rapid, Darwinian evolutionary pressure that forces protocols to achieve a level of security and efficiency far exceeding what is typically seen in the slower, more insulated development cycles of traditional finance.</p>

<p>Beyond finance and assets, Web3 introduces new primitives for how humans can coordinate, make collective decisions, and manage shared resources. This organizational layer is primarily defined by the structure of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and the various mechanisms they employ for governance.</p>
<h3 id="51-the-organizational-structure-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-daos"><strong>5.1 The Organizational Structure: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#51-the-organizational-structure-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-daos" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a novel organizational structure that is community-owned and managed, operating on a blockchain according to rules encoded in smart contracts.112 DAOs are often described as “internet-native entities” that function without a central governing body or traditional hierarchical management.25 Instead, decisions are made collectively by their members, typically through a token-based voting system.114</p>
<p>The core components of a DAO are built upon the foundational primitives of Web3. They are constructed on public blockchain infrastructures like Ethereum, their governance is intended to be decentralized, and their operations are mediated by a combination of on-chain smart contracts and off-chain communication platforms (like forums and chat servers).113 The smart contracts define the fundamental rules of the organization: how to become a member, how to submit proposals, how to vote, and how to manage the organization’s treasury. These rules are self-executing and transparently enforced by the blockchain.115</p>
<p>The significance of the DAO as a primitive lies in its potential to reinvent human coordination. It enables global, pseudonymous communities to collaborate on shared goals, collectively manage treasuries that can be worth billions of dollars, and govern complex software protocols without relying on traditional corporate structures, legal agreements, or geographic jurisdictions.115 They are being used for a wide variety of purposes, from governing DeFi protocols and managing investment funds to funding public goods and organizing social clubs.113</p>

<p>The primary mechanism for decision-making within a DAO is voting, which is facilitated by governance tokens and a variety of voting systems.</p>
<p><strong>Governance Tokens</strong> are typically ERC-20 tokens that grant their holders the right to participate in the DAO’s governance process.119 By holding the token, a member gains the ability to create proposals and vote on issues affecting the protocol, such as software upgrades, treasury allocations, or changes to governance parameters themselves.119 This model aligns the incentives of the protocol’s users and stakeholders with its long-term success, as they are empowered to collectively steer its direction.107</p>
<h4 id="521-foundational-models-token-based-and-quorum-voting"><strong>5.2.1 Foundational Models: Token-Based and Quorum Voting</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#521-foundational-models-token-based-and-quorum-voting" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h4>
<p>The most common and straightforward voting model is <strong>Token-Based Voting</strong>, often referred to as “one-token-one-vote” (1T1V). In this system, a member’s voting power is directly proportional to the number of governance tokens they hold.120 This model ties influence directly to economic stake, or “skin in the game,” under the assumption that those with the largest financial investment are most incentivized to act in the DAO’s best interest.123 However, its primary drawback is the risk of plutocracy, where wealthy individuals or “whales” can accumulate a majority of the tokens and dominate the decision-making process, potentially at the expense of smaller token holders.119</p>
<p>To address issues of low voter turnout, many DAOs implement <strong>Quorum Voting</strong>. This mechanism requires a minimum percentage of the total token supply (a quorum) to participate in a vote for the result to be considered valid.124 This prevents a small, active minority from passing significant proposals without sufficient community engagement. However, setting the quorum at an appropriate level is a persistent challenge; too high, and it can lead to governance gridlock where no proposals can pass, while too low, it fails to prevent capture by small but organized groups.124</p>

<p>As DAOs have matured, more sophisticated voting primitives have been developed to address the shortcomings of the basic 1T1V model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quadratic Voting (QV):</strong> This mechanism is designed to allow voters to express the <em>intensity</em> of their preferences, rather than just their direction.126 In QV, voters are allocated a budget of “voice credits.” The cost to cast votes for a proposal increases quadratically: 1 vote costs 1 credit, 2 votes cost 4 credits, 3 votes cost 9 credits, and so on (<br/>
cost=votes2).126 This makes it exponentially more expensive to cast multiple votes for a single issue, incentivizing voters to spread their credits across the issues they care most about. QV aims to mitigate the “tyranny of the majority” and reduce the power of large token holders, providing a more balanced outcome that reflects the collective preference intensity of the entire community.125</li>
<li><strong>Conviction Voting:</strong> This primitive introduces the dimension of time into the voting process. In conviction voting, a member’s voting power on a specific proposal increases the longer they “stake” or lock their tokens in support of it.129 A proposal passes once it has accumulated a sufficient threshold of “conviction” over time. This system favors persistent, long-term support from the community over the short-term mobilization of large amounts of capital. It is particularly effective at funding public goods and is inherently resistant to governance attacks using flash loans, as influence cannot be acquired instantaneously.129</li>
<li><strong>Holographic Consensus:</strong> Pioneered by the DAOstack platform, Holographic Consensus is a mechanism designed to manage the attention economy of a large-scale DAO.131 It addresses the problem that as a DAO grows, it becomes impossible for every member to vote on every proposal. The system works by creating a prediction market around each proposal. Members can stake tokens to predict whether a proposal is likely to pass or fail. Proposals that attract a significant amount of positive staking get “boosted,” which lowers their required voting quorum from an absolute majority (e.g., >50% of all possible votes) to a more achievable relative majority (e.g., >50% of votes cast).131 This effectively acts as a filter, focusing the collective attention of the broader voting base onto the proposals that the most engaged members believe have the highest merit and chance of success.132</li>

<p>The DAO treasury is the collective pool of financial resources owned and controlled by the organization’s members.136 These funds, typically consisting of the DAO’s native governance token, stablecoins, and other crypto-assets, are held in on-chain accounts and are used to finance operations, fund development grants, invest in strategic initiatives, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.137 Effective treasury management is a critical function for any successful DAO.</p>
<p>Several key primitives and strategies are employed for secure and effective treasury management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Signature (Multisig) Wallets:</strong> A fundamental security primitive for DAOs. A multisig wallet is a smart contract that requires multiple pre-approved members (keyholders) to sign off on a transaction before it can be executed.137 This prevents a single individual from having unilateral control over the funds and protects against theft or loss of a single private key, distributing trust across a committee.137</li>
<li><strong>Diversification:</strong> A core risk management strategy. Many DAOs make the mistake of holding the majority of their treasury in their own volatile native token.139 A prudent treasury management strategy involves diversifying the treasury into a portfolio of assets, including less volatile stablecoins (like USDC or DAI) and other established cryptocurrencies (like ETH), to preserve capital and ensure the DAO can meet its operational expenses regardless of market conditions.137</li>
<li><strong>Governance-Driven Allocation:</strong> The ultimate control over the treasury rests with the DAO members. All decisions regarding spending, investments, and diversification strategies are subject to the DAO’s formal governance process. Proposals are made, debated by the community, and voted on by token holders, ensuring that the management of the collective’s funds is transparent, democratic, and aligned with the organization’s stated mission.136</li>

<p>The final layer of the Web3 stack consists of infrastructure primitives that provide essential services to the entire ecosystem. These primitives solve critical problems related to data access, storage, and interoperability, making it possible to build robust, performant, and interconnected decentralized applications.</p>

<p>Blockchains, by design, are deterministic and isolated systems. They can execute code with verifiable certainty but have no native capability to access data from the outside world, such as real-world asset prices, weather information, or the results of a sports game.140 This fundamental limitation is known as the</p>
<p><strong>oracle problem</strong>.142 Without a way to bridge this gap, the utility of smart contracts would be severely limited to on-chain-native applications.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain oracles</strong> are the middleware primitive designed to solve this problem. They act as a secure bridge, fetching external, off-chain data and delivering it onto the blockchain for smart contracts to consume.141 However, using a single, centralized oracle reintroduces a single point of failure and trust into a trustless system, undermining the core value proposition of the blockchain.141</p>
<p>To solve this, <strong>decentralized oracle networks (DONs)</strong>, such as Chainlink, were developed.144 A DON consists of a network of multiple, independent oracle nodes. When a smart contract requests data, multiple nodes in the network fetch the information from various high-quality off-chain sources. They then come to a consensus on the correct value before it is aggregated and delivered on-chain.140 This decentralized approach ensures that the data is highly available, accurate, and resistant to manipulation, as an attacker would need to compromise a significant number of independent nodes and data sources simultaneously.141 Oracles are a critical infrastructure primitive that makes smart contracts truly “smart” by connecting them to the vast data of the real world, enabling the entire DeFi ecosystem, which relies heavily on real-time price feeds for functions like managing collateral and executing liquidations.140</p>

<p>Storing large amounts of data, such as images, videos, or extensive datasets, directly on a Layer 1 blockchain like Ethereum is technically possible but prohibitively expensive due to the cost of gas for every byte of data. The conventional alternative, centralized cloud storage services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Drive, reintroduces centralization, creating single points of failure, censorship risks, and giving control of the data to a third-party corporation.146</p>
<p><strong>Decentralized storage networks</strong> have emerged as a primitive to solve this issue. These networks distribute and store data across a global, peer-to-peer network of nodes, with no single entity in control.146 This approach provides enhanced security, censorship resistance, and data redundancy.147 Two prominent examples of this primitive are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):</strong> IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol for storing and sharing files. Its core innovation is <strong>content addressing</strong>. Instead of identifying a file by its location (like a URL), IPFS identifies a file by a unique cryptographic hash of its content, known as a Content Identifier (CID).149 This means that the content itself is the address. This makes data verifiable (you can check if the content matches the hash) and inherently censorship-resistant (as long as one node on the network is hosting the content, it remains accessible). When a user requests a file via its CID, the network uses a<br/>
<strong>Distributed Hash Table (DHT)</strong> to find the nearest peers hosting that content and retrieves it from them.152</li>
<li><strong>Arweave:</strong> Arweave is a decentralized storage network specifically designed for <strong>permanent data storage</strong>. It introduces a novel blockchain-like data structure called the <strong>blockweave</strong> and a unique consensus mechanism called <strong>Proof of Access (PoA)</strong>.154 In the PoA system, to mine a new block, a miner must prove they have access to a randomly selected previous block from the network’s history. Since miners cannot predict which block they will need, they are incentivized to store as much of the network’s data as possible.154 Arweave’s economic model is also unique: users pay a single, upfront fee to store data. This fee is used to create a storage endowment that is designed to pay for the cost of storing that data in perpetuity, based on the assumption that the cost of data storage will continue to decline over time.154</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="63-decentralized-data-indexing-protocols"><strong>6.3 Decentralized Data Indexing Protocols</strong><a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#63-decentralized-data-indexing-protocols" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>While blockchains are excellent at storing data immutably, they are notoriously inefficient to query. Data is stored chronologically in a sequence of blocks, not in a structured, indexed database that can be easily searched.160 A dApp needing to display a user’s transaction history or all the NFTs they own would have to scan the entire blockchain from the beginning, which is impractical for any real-time application.161</p>
<p><strong>Decentralized indexing protocols</strong> like The Graph have emerged as a crucial middleware primitive to solve this data accessibility problem.162 The Graph acts as an indexing layer that organizes blockchain data and makes it easily queryable via standard APIs.163</p>
<p>The mechanism involves several key roles within a decentralized network 162:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subgraph Developers</strong> create open APIs called “subgraphs,” which define what data to index from a specific smart contract and how to structure it.</li>
<li><strong>Indexers</strong> are node operators who stake The Graph’s native token (GRT) and run the software to process these subgraphs, indexing the specified blockchain data.</li>
<li><strong>Curators</strong> are participants who signal which subgraphs are of high quality and should be indexed by staking GRT on them.</li>
<li><strong>Delegators</strong> stake their GRT on existing Indexers to help secure the network without running a node themselves, earning a portion of the Indexer’s rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers</strong> (dApps, analysts, etc.) pay query fees in GRT to the Indexers to retrieve the indexed data using the simple and widely adopted GraphQL query language.163</li>
</ul>
<p>This primitive is essential for the usability of the Web3 ecosystem, providing the fast and efficient data retrieval necessary to build performant dApps, effectively abstracting away the immense complexity of directly querying raw blockchain data.168</p>

<p>A significant and rapidly developing category of primitives is focused on identity and social interaction. This layer aims to fundamentally restructure the Web2 model, where user identity and social data are controlled and monetized by centralized platforms like Facebook and Google, and instead give ownership and control back to the user.10</p>
<p>The key primitives in this space include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):</strong> DIDs are a new type of globally unique identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID is controlled by the user themselves (making it “self-sovereign”) and does not depend on any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.170 This allows users to create and manage their own digital identities that are portable across different applications and services.</li>
<li><strong>Social Graphs:</strong> These are protocols that represent a user’s social connections, content, and followers as user-owned, portable data structures.10 Instead of a social graph being locked within a single platform’s database, it can be stored on a decentralized network or represented as on-chain assets (e.g., NFTs), allowing the user to take their network with them from one application to another.173 The ability for users to “truly own their own online profile, including all of the content they’ve produced and their following/follower social graphs” has been described as a powerful and foundational Web3 primitive.10</li>
</ul>
<p>These identity and social primitives are the building blocks for a new generation of decentralized social media, reputation systems, and a more open, interoperable social internet where users are no longer locked into walled gardens but are free to move and interact across a diverse ecosystem of applications.</p>
<p>The primitives that constitute this infrastructure layer are not merely new tools; they represent a systematic effort to build a parallel, fully decentralized technology stack from the ground up. Each of these primitives directly targets and replaces a core, centralized component of the traditional Web2 architecture. In the Web2 world, data is stored on centralized servers like AWS S3; Web3 offers decentralized alternatives like IPFS and Arweave.146 In Web2, data is queried from proprietary, centralized databases via private APIs; Web3 provides open, decentralized indexing through protocols like The Graph.162 Web2 applications rely on trusted, centralized APIs for external data feeds; Web3 uses decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink to deliver this data trustlessly.144 Finally, where Web2 identity is federated and controlled by large platforms, Web3 is building a future of self-sovereign identity through DIDs and user-owned social graphs.170 This reveals a comprehensive and ambitious vision: not just to build new applications on a blockchain, but to fundamentally re-architect the essential services of the internet in a more open, resilient, and user-centric manner.</p>

<p>This report has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of the fundamental primitives that constitute the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem. The analysis reveals a layered, interconnected, and highly composable technology stack. At the base, the foundational layer—comprising the EVM, smart contracts, and Proof-of-Stake consensus—provides a secure and programmable bedrock for decentralized computation. Building upon this, cryptographic primitives like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Layer 2 Rollups are enabling new frontiers of privacy and scalability. The asset layer, with its standardized token formats, allows for the fluid creation and exchange of digital value in both fungible and non-fungible forms.</p>
<p>These lower-level components serve as the building blocks for more complex systems. The DeFi layer demonstrates the power of composability in its purest form, where primitives like AMMs, lending protocols, and flash loans are combined and recombined to create a sophisticated and rapidly evolving open financial system. Similarly, the organizational layer, centered on the DAO, offers a new paradigm for collective action and governance. Finally, the infrastructure layer provides the crucial connective tissue—oracles, storage, indexing, and identity—that makes the entire ecosystem functional, usable, and connected to the broader world.</p>
<p>The true power of this ecosystem lies not in any single primitive, but in their ability to be permissionlessly combined. Consider the creation of a modern DeFi application: it might use the ERC-20 standard (Part III) for its governance token, which is traded on an AMM (Part IV). The protocol’s core logic is governed by a DAO (Part V) that uses a decentralized oracle network (Part VI) to access real-time price data, all while its front-end is hosted on decentralized storage (Part VI) and its transactions are executed on a Layer 2 rollup (Part II) that ultimately settles to the Ethereum foundational layer (Part I). This seamless integration of disparate, independently developed primitives is the hallmark of Web3 innovation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this technical taxonomy connects back to the broader vision of Web3: to construct an internet where users have greater ownership of their assets, control over their data, and sovereignty over their digital identity.1 The evolution from purely financial primitives toward more complex social and identity-based primitives signals the maturation of this vision. The ever-expanding toolkit of decentralized primitives is not merely an academic or technical exercise; it is the practical foundation upon which a more equitable, transparent, and user-owned digital future is being built.4</p></article><hr/><div class="page-footer"></div></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div class="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[],&quot;focusOnHover&quot;:false,&quot;enableRadial&quot;:false}"></div><button class="global-graph-icon" aria-label="Global Graph"><svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xml:space="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
