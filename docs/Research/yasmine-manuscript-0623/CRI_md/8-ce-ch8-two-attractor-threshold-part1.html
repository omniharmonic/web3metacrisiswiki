<p>There are government departments, IGOs, militaries, non-profits,
corporations and other institutions whose stated purpose is to prevent
and mitigate risks in each of the above categories. New risks are being
met with new methods of management, including valuable efforts in
conservation, disarmament and AI governance. However, many of the
individual risks discussed above are still trending in the wrong
direction, and the metacrisis as a whole is mostly unaddressed. Even
more concerning are the ways responses to individual risks are actually
displacing harm elsewhere and accelerating the metacrisis as a whole.
This is a major topic of future chapters. Since the underlying causes of
the risks are not being adequately addressed, strategies to address
particular threats end up exacerbating the overall situation, and
attempts at problem solving often cause more problems.</p>
<p>The current world system is not suited to address the increasing number
of highly consequential threats, the speed at which we are approaching
them, and the overall complexity of the situation as a whole. Therefore,
the primary concern of this book is that civilization may be incapable
of</p>
<p>preventing global catastrophes, or to do so will centralize power and
control in an oppressive and dystopian fashion^1^.</p>
<p>The first outcome is one probable future for a world beset by
metacrisis: an attractor drawing civilization towards chaos and
breakdown. It would result from the mismanagement of the risk categories
discussed above and the systematic overwhelm of institutions tasked with
safety and sustainability. The pull towards chaos is inextricably linked
with its counterpart: a corresponding attractor moving towards the
consolidation of unchecked power and centralized surveillance and
control. When catastrophes become more likely, drastic responses also
begin to appear more reasonable. Hierarchical command and control can be
made to seem tolerable and justifiable when it promises safety and
security against risks such as terrorism, war, environmental crises,
economic breakdown, or deadly pandemics. Each step towards chaos will be
met with an authoritarian impulse. But the opposite is also true.
Centralization and control will generate resistance and rebellion,
increasing chaos. Movement towards one attractor will tend to involve
counter responses towards the other.</p>
<p>These two states are being referred to as “attractors” — drawing
metaphorical inspiration from the science of complex systems^2^. This is
a way of talking about and modeling topographically---like a 3D map of a
landscape---all the possible states that a system can assume, and the
likelihood of it being in any given state in that landscape in the
future. Hard to achieve states are modeled as “mountains,” easy to
achieve ones as basins or “valleys.” Some states are much more likely to
be occupied than others in the future---these appear as deep basins of
attraction in the topography, drawing the future into their direction.</p>

<p>There are fascinating efforts in complex systems theory and
computational social science to mathematically formalize how social
systems move between attractor states^3^. For our purposes, however,
these terms are being used as first principles. They help us discipline
our imagination about possible futures and bring into language holistic
intuitions about the (in)stability and probable trajectories of the
current world system.</p>

<p>In a highly uncertain, rapidly changing, chaotic environment,
hierarchical control can have competitive advantages over democratic
methods of choice-making. In these contexts, systems of political power
— such as legal institutions, corporations, militaries, intelligence
agencies, IGOs, NGOs, etc. — are partially shaped by their need to
secure power, stabilize social order, defend against outside threats,
and prevent runaway catastrophes. Throughout history it has</p>
<p>^3^ See the work of Peter Turchin, e.g., Turchin, P., &amp; Nefedov, S. A.
(2009). <em>Secular Cycles</em>. Princeton University Press.</p>
<p>As well as Sabin Roman, e.g., Sabin, R., Palmer, E. (2019). *The Growth
and Decline of the Western Roman Empire: Quantifying the Dynamics of
Army Size, Territory,and Coinage. *Cliodynamics 10: 76—98.</p>
<p>been commonplace for citizen rights and political participation to prove
secondary to these other basic concerns when a society finds itself in
the midst of chaos^4^.</p>
<p>There are significant strategic tradeoffs between autocratic and
democratic decision making^5^. Voting and deliberation, for example, can
be slow and wander into gridlock. But a single decision maker needs only
trust their own judgment and can respond quickly and decisively. They
can also plan on longer time horizons. Term limits in a democracy serve
as a check on the consolidation of power, but they also pressure
politicians to prioritize policy decisions relevant to the time frame of
re-election. Furthermore, this means elected officials are able to
dismantle the work of those who preceded them. A life-long emperor with
a dynasty or a succession plan, however, can execute a strategy spanning
several generations.</p>
<p>Concentrated systems of power allow for more efficient and coherent
decision making, but they also risk grave abuses of power. Concentrated
power is alluring for more reasons than just its strategic benefits, and
it tends to attract people into positions of leadership who are willing
to abuse it (see the section below on “Why Absolute Power Corrupts
Absolutely”). Distributed systems of power, on the other hand, are based
on checks and balances: where someone has power, there is a check on its
concentration, and therefore, a limit on its potential abuse.</p>

<p>^5^ Autocracy and democracy are concepts, which seek to represent highly
divergent realities. For example, while the US is used here as an
example of a democracy, research has shown that changes in public
opinion has little effect on US regulation. The majority of public
policy is reflective of coordinated activity by wealthy special
interests groups. Gilens, M., &amp; Page, B. I. (2014). *Testing Theories of

<p>However, each check on power is also a constraint on decision making,
which can slow collective action and pose the risk of indecision and
incoherence.</p>
<p>Many of these and other trade offs were well known, and often accounted
for, by the designers of modern democracies. This is why, for example,
militaries are hierarchical, and there is a commander-in-chief who makes
executive decisions during war. Democracy was, in part, conceived of as
the best way to make collective choices <em>in times of peace^6^</em>. In
conditions of war and emergency, civil liberties are often suspended
even in the most open of societies^7^. This is yet another factor
pulling us towards oppression: as the Metacrisis deepens into a state of
continuous war and emergency, the assumed peace-time basis for
democratic life erodes.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged that democracies have outcompeted autocracies at
different points throughout history. There are several strategic
advantages to free and open political participation (in addition to
their ethical value). By incentivizing the distributed intelligence of
the people through civic engagement and entrepreneurship, democratic
social forms can create a type of *collective intelligence *which is not
strictly limited to an isolated political class. Open societies can be
major hubs for technological and cultural innovation and are often able
to attract the best talent from around the world. These and other
factors have tipped the scales in favor of participatory governance in
the past.</p>
<p>But the world is changing, and shifting conditions may now be favoring
autocratic response, even in areas where democracy was previously
preferred. For example, consider the recent responses of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) to the disruptive effects of social media and
other digital technologies. Initial indicators suggest that, due to the
different approaches to regulation and technology policy, social media
in China resulted in increased coherence of their national government
and popular support, rather than the increased polarization and public
discontent that took place in many western countries^8^.</p>
<p>^6^ This is clear in the tripartite model of the US government, for
example, where the President is also the commander in chief of the
military.</p>
<p>^7^ Cheek, N. N., Reutskaja, E., &amp; Schwartz, B. (2022). Balancing the
Freedom—Security Trade-Off During Crises and Disasters. Perspectives on
Psychological Science, 17(4), 1024-1049.</p>
<p>^8^ This is talked about in the Consilience Papers, see…</p>
<p>[The Case of Social Media]{.underline}</p>
<p>Open societies (particularly the US, and to some extent the EU) have
struggled to adapt to the effect social media had on public discourse.
For instance, in the US, it has been shown that people who share
political content on social media are demonstrably worse at estimating
the beliefs of others in different political parties. Social media has
been shown to increase “perception gaps,” measurable distances of how
far people’s beliefs are from social reality.^9^ This is one factor that
increases political polarization and fragments the public sphere into
groups that believe and act as if they live in totally different
realities.</p>
<p>These platforms don’t support nuanced conversations capable of
representing and integrating multiple opposing viewpoints — one of the
central promises and values of democracy. News feeds and other features
of user experience are intentionally designed by machine learning and
software engineers to maximize user engagement on the platform, increase
ad-revenue, and accomplish other company goals. However, the content
which is most likely to get engagement (likes, shares, and comments) is
often also what is most effective at hijacking our emotions, like
extreme and divisive political content. The most engaging posts on
political issues are often takedowns and the most cynical possible
interpretations of the other party’s behavior. This carves the
population into warring tribes, where the most politically engaged and
influential citizens are also the most extreme and reactionary. A
vicious cycle ensues: a more radicalized support base elects a more
radicalized representative class who must appeal to their base in more
extreme ways and so on. This is a downward spiral, accelerating
democratic dysfunction, and driving legislative grid-lock, ineffective
policy, and political violence.</p>
<p>Democracy cannot persist in a world where the more aggressive and
divisive a citizen is, the louder their microphone. This is not
reducible to a simple issue of free speech. Rather, it is an example of
how democracies must adapt to novel technologies that fundamentally
disrupt our politics and culture. Addressing this challenge is an
existential necessity for open societies. The degradation of public
discourse has resulted in a fractured public unable to agree on the
realities of all of the most consequential issues facing humanity. Will
AGI save, enslave, or kill</p>
<p>^9^ Yudkin, D., Hawkins, S., Dixon, T. (2019). *The Perception Gap: How
False Impressions are Pulling Americans Apart. *Hidden Tribes, More in
Common. ; Christian S.B. Overgaard. (2024). <em>Perceiving Affective
Polarization in the United States</em>. Social Media <em>+ Society 10</em>(1).</p>
<p>us all? How should we respond to the unspeakable violence taking place
in Ukraine and the Middle East? Are ecological issues like climate
change existential emergencies or completely overblown? If we are to
respond to environmental risks, should we do so by rapidly accelerating
technological advancement to create abundant fusion energy and become an
interplanetary species, or by simplifying our lives, lowering
consumption, and slowing down economic growth? Our answers to these
questions are of existential importance for the future of civilization.</p>
<p>However, it can seem impossible to even engage in these conversations
without ending up in bitter conflict. Neither side may be willing to
consider an alternative perspective, or worse, is certain that they are
correct, and that the other side’s answer will get us all killed.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the CCP, who has enforced powerful regulations on
their social media and other digital technology companies in ways that
immediately increased national coherence and competitive advantage. For
example, the CCP has banned most forms of content which are not
educational or patriotic in nature. Children and teenagers using social
media are shown science experiments and examples of Chinese
technological and industrial advancement. Youth have limited hours of
access to social media, with designated “opening and closing hours.”
Cell phone usage is not allowed in school. When using online platforms,
there is strict identity verification, including the use of facial
recognition software, and individuals are discouraged from posting
content anonymously. To prevent radicalization, disenfranchisement, and
dysfunction, military personnel are issued party approved phones that
are registered with their commanding unit and tightly monitored and
controlled.</p>
<p>These are highly strategic responses to the novel challenges posed by
emerging technologies of social influence. A population subject to these
policies is less polarized and addicted to their devices, and more
educated, patriotic, and ideologically coherent, with longer attention
spans, less emotional reactivity, and generally greater productivity.
Furthermore, many Chinese citizens come to expect their government to
regulate their technology companies in these ways, and may even have a
sense of national pride surrounding it. However, these interventions
would generally be seen as unacceptable in most liberal democracies, in
part because they come at the expense of civil liberties and individual
freedoms and pose the risk of power abuse^10^. Such</p>
<p>^10^ However, proofs of Social Media corporations in western democracies
moderating content for political purposes, such as the Twitter Files,
and more generally shaping public opinion through large-scale behavior
control, demonstrate that risks to individual freedoms and power abuse
are present in also the liberal approach to technology regulation. Both
the Chinese and western approach involve public behavior modification by
centralized powers. With the onset of these technologies and the scale
of the associated corporate power, autocratic risk is now present from
both governmental and corporate sides.</p>
<p>powerful regulations depend on the necessary components of monitoring
and enforcement, which often slide into invasive, totalizing systems of
surveillance and control, and the violent punishment of dissident
voices.</p>

<p>Similar to the risks discussed in the preceding chapters, the age-old
tension between democracy and autocracy — between distributing power
and concentrating it — has taken on a new form in today’s environment
of high-technology. A hierarchically managed, technologically advanced
state has access to massive amounts of personalized data to monitor
their population, including digital interactions, biometrics, and
real-time geolocation. Online platforms and commonplace smart-devices
such as phones, watches, televisions, vehicles, and at-home assistants
(e.g., Alexa) are continuously collecting intimate and invasive
information on the entire population’s behavior: what time we go to
sleep and wake up, which side of the bed we sleep on, where we go when
we leave the house, how we act on the car ride to work (when we think
we’re alone), what we watch and listen to when we get home, who we
communicate with throughout the day, and what our biological signatures
are throughout all of those activities. This data is then sold and
exchanged between companies to train ever-more sophisticated models
upon: a transnational, trans-organizational, techno-oligopoly whose
infrastructure allows for the near omniscient awareness of civilian
behavior. The currently highest order global infrastructure is what has
been called the planetary computational stack, which now encircles the
Earth in a lattice of communicative silicon, facilitating the emergence
of the so-called Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Humanity is currently witnessing the real time enclosure of the planet
in a web of data and sensor networks that enable digitally mediated
agents---artificial and human---to be integrated into vast cybernetic
control structures.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the preceding chapters, new tech always enables new
forms of social organization. The written word, for example, allowed
humans to maintain detailed systems of records and accounts required for
complex bureaucracies — enabling large-scale, city-states. The printing
press disseminated the means of sharing knowledge (e.g,. books) and
opened up the realm of public discourse to a wider class — driving
Europe out of feudalism into modernity.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies are causing changes to civilization which are at
least as radical as these past innovations. There is a natural appeal to
integrating these technologies into new methods of governance.
Satellites and sensor technology, for example, can perform real-time
monitoring on everything from pollution streams to human trafficking.
Each innovation opens up new possibilities for preventing catastrophes
and pursuing prosperity. However, humanity’s track record of wielding
power without corruption and abuse does not bode well for safe
stewardship of exponential technological powers. Optimism for innovation
must be bound by the precedents of the misuse and misapplication of
power (see the following section).</p>
<p>For better and for worse, technologies are extensions of human capacity
which allow us to overcome our natural, corporeal limits. In the past,
there were limits to autocratic rule. Limits which are now being
overcome. It was not possible to monitor everyone’s behavior before
widely distributed sensor technology and ubiquitous personal smart
devices. Without advances in machine learning, it would have been
impossible to process that amount of information. Now, in conjunction
with a fully integrated social credit system — where each citizen is
scored based on their alignment with the mandates of the ruling class —
misbehavior can be automatically and immediately identified and punished
with artificially intelligent policing.</p>
<p>Humans may soon be crossing a <em><strong>technocratic threshold</strong></em>, entering a
world of omniscient surveillance and omnipotent enforcement. This is a
world run by all-knowing, all-powerful authoritarian technocrats whose
tireless pursuits for predictive precision, control, resource
extraction, and power accumulation are hidden behind a veil of virtuous
promises. Near unlimited force will be unleashed in the name of justice,
but done so in a way that undermines the possibility of anything truly
worthy of the name. Most importantly, this is a world where “resistance
is futile”---where the asymmetric power is so great that all prior means
used to overthrow authoritarian rule are rendered obsolete. Thus no
feasible “way out” can be imagined.</p>
<p>This world may not be one filled with overt punishment and violence. New
technologies also enable nuanced and subtle means of propaganda and
social control. AI recommendation systems like those used by Youtube or
TikTok, for example, have profound capabilities in predicting and
influencing the behavior of billions of users. In market contexts, these
technologies enable customized behavior modification which can be used
to achieve company goals, e.g., to increase returns to shareholders by
maximizing the user’s engagement on site,</p>
<p>increasing their purchases and even shaping their political preferences.
As mentioned above, these capabilities can easily be repurposed to serve
the will of a state.</p>
<p>*Generative AI *(e.g., chat-GPT, gemini, mid-journey) is another major
development in social influence technology. Platforms employing AI
recommendation systems like Instagram and Youtube were designed to
<em>curate human generated content</em>, such as articles or advertisements,
that best captured the attention of the user. Generative AI is not
limited to simply curating content, it can create it. With personal data
harvesting and AI driven generation of text, images, videos, and even
virtual environments, there exists the deeply concerning potential for a
massive system of social influence utilizing artificially generated
content personalized to the preferences (and susceptibilities) of each
individual citizen optimized to serve the goals of the technocratic
class.</p>
<p>With innovations in sensors, robotics, brain-computer interfaces,
augmented reality, digital currencies, and AI there is now the very real
possibility of a type of authoritarianism which was once the subject of
science fiction. Such a system of government could look radically
different from those of the past including forms of persuasion and
influence which appear as consent. Moreover, the creation of an
authoritarian government may not require a violent coup d’état. It could
emerge gradually and begin with policies that initially seem like
reasonable steps towards safety. However, given new technological
capabilities, the passive acceptance of increasing centralized control
poses the risk of an inescapable, runaway consolidation of power.</p>
<p>[Why Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely]{.underline}</p>
<p>Given the threats to all of life posed by the risks mentioned in the
preceding chapters, the consolidations of power and enforcement
described above can be made to appear necessary. Yet anytime an entity
(such as a person or institution) is granted greater power, it must
hinge on their legitimacy, trustworthiness, and genuine epistemic
authority. Trustworthy systems of power depend upon rigorous checks and
balances where the potential for consolidation and abuse are limited by
design. However, to place a check on power requires a force of
comparable stature, and the asymmetric power gained via certain advanced
technologies may undermine the possibilities for check and balances.</p>
<p>Those groups building and using technologies like AI become radically
more powerful as they have increasing access to data and compute. It is
effectively impossible for a startup to collect the data and build the
underwater data centers and cloud computing infrastructure needed to
train models at the scale of Google, Amazon, or Microsoft, for example.
When AI infrastructure operating at this scale is integrated into
defense and intelligence systems, and given access to classified
information and weapons technologies, a relatively small group of people
begins to accumulate power so great that it could become incredibly
difficult to check.</p>
<p>An autocratic leader willing to employ these technologies to protect
their power would be vastly more difficult to overthrow than at any
prior point in history. In an age of conventional weaponry, it was much
easier (though still quite difficult) for a population to upend a
corrupt government. When intelligent systems can employ satellites and
smartphones to listen to all public conversations, track location in
real time, and employ drone swarms for assassination, popular revolt and
revolution becomes nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Even when power systems are designed with checks and balances, they
often erode. There will always be more people who desire power than
there will be available positions of power. Those in such positions tend
to be highly motivated to maintain them and will use all of their
available resources to do so. If anyone is able to gain power by
sacrificing certain value commitments (for example, being deceptive,
manipulative, or violent), everyone else seeking power is pressured to
act similarly, driving leaders to sacrifice their morality for strategic
practicality. Those most skilled in these power games are rarely the
wisest and most just stewards of power. In those unlikely scenarios
where leaders are genuinely ethical and trustworthy, they are still
forced to contend with everyone else who is willing to use malevolent
means to take their position.</p>
<p>This discussion demonstrates the importance of questions about how to
create trustworthy, enduring systems of power — which are able to
employ advanced technology while resisting the forces of corruption and
decay. This is an essential challenge related to all efforts towards a
third attractor.</p>
<h2 id="movement-and-variation-between-attractorsunderline">[Movement and Variation Between Attractors]{.underline}<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#movement-and-variation-between-attractorsunderline" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Even without power systems becoming more trustworthy, centralization
will be put forth as a response to increasing risks. The application of
advanced technologies (digital, biological, surveillance, and memetic)
to prevent anything outside real-time centralized regulation will be
used to cut off variation in human behavior to optimize for prediction
and control. This could stop cascading catastrophes in the short term,
but it could also be the result of the politically opportunistic class
capitalizing on engineered or over-exaggerated crises in order to
consolidate power. Both paths can lead to control structures that
drastically foreclose on ethically desirable futures. Worst case
scenario is one of dystopian global authoritarian use of exponential
technologies of social control made subject to corruption and perpetual,
inescapable misuse.</p>
<p>Many variations exist across the two attractors of chaos and oppression.
For example, rather than a single, global autocracy, there may be
several authoritarian systems which arise in response to increasing
catastrophes. In some instances, these hierarchical control structures
may not even be states but corporate technocracies whose consolidated
power and capital grant increasing control over the population.
Similarly, there may not be a single global catastrophe or extinction
event but an increase in larger, more frequent and consequential local
catastrophes.</p>
<p>There is also likely to be ongoing oscillation between attractors,
rather than total global lock-in for one or the other. It is perhaps
more accurate to think of these attractors as two sides of the same
coin. Their coevolution is, to some extent, the dominant attractor. As
powerful technologies decentralize and the planetary situation becomes
more dire, there will be increasing surveillance and regulatory
centralization. In turn, each step towards authoritarian control will be
matched with self-organizing guerrilla resistance which may drive local
or global catastrophes as a result. It is likely that the future is
defined by more severe catastrophes and more dystopic responses, a world
of diminished freedoms and an increasingly scorched earth.</p>
<p>*<strong>Each</strong> <strong>attractor</strong> <strong>reinforces</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>other,</strong> <strong>and</strong>
<strong>advanced</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> <strong>drive</strong> <strong>both</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>parallel.</strong>
***On the one hand, emerging tech decentralizes power. Innovations in
AI, synthetic biology, and drones would have once required the budgets
of the richest nation states and militaries in the world. Now they are
being widely distributed, increasing the capability of non-state actors
to disrupt the agendas of powerful nations and corporations. On the
other hand, these technologies also orient towards increasing
centralization — for example, due to economies of scale, network
effects, and the benefits of increasing data and information processing.
They</p>
<p>allow for larger scale, more complex authoritarian structures than ever
before by overcoming past limiting factors in behavioral monitoring,
data processing, speed and fidelity of communications, and mechanisms of
policy enforcement. The proliferation of technology makes it more
difficult both to contain decentralized power and to maintain
appropriate checks and balances on consolidated power.</p>
<p>Oscillations between chaos and oppression are already present around the
world and causes of harm on both human and ecological terms. Even if the
extremes of these attractors are dampened, a world of growing
catastrophes and increasingly invasive surveillance and control is still
unacceptable. These outcomes warrant large scale transformations of
world system dynamics and coordinated effort to reimagine and realize
alternative paths towards a sustainable and humane civilization.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-the-global-risk-thresholdunderline">[Beyond the Global Risk Threshold]{.underline}<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#beyond-the-global-risk-thresholdunderline" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h1>
<p>Humanity must address the deeper causes underlying the proliferation of
global catastrophic risks and the threat of dystopian oppression.
Several of these — *generative dynamics of the metacrisis *— were
mentioned throughout this chapter, such as the strategic benefits of
hierarchical control and violence, the competitive pressures
accelerating technology development, and the economic growth obligations
driving ecological overshoot.</p>
<p>These and other generative dynamics of risk, violence, and civilization
decay have been prevalent throughout history. It is only recently that
they have been technologically empowered at this scale such that they
are causes of global catastrophic and existential risks, and are
imminently self-terminating for the species as a whole. <em><strong>This
signifies the crossing of a threshold, where civilization</strong>’<strong>s new
found existential power brings with it unprecedented planetary</strong>
<strong>responsibility</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>need</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>profound</strong>
<strong>structural</strong> <strong>change</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>its</strong> <strong>basic</strong> <strong>modes of
operating.</strong></em></p>
<p>A critical factor moving us beyond this threshold is the state of
technology and its unique capabilities, unprecedented power, rapid speed
of development, and widespread distribution. Industrial technology can
scale extraction and pollution to the point of an uninhabitable earth in
a way impossible without it. Nuclear, biological, and autonomous weapons
turn total war from locally catastrophic to civilization ruining.
Technologies like AI and synthetic biology will widely distribute the
ability to cause global catastrophic risks either by intentional attack
or unintended consequence. Lastly, the dissemination of new technologies
pushes the world system towards ubiquitous surveillance and the
possibility of totalizing dystopian control.</p>
<p>To successfully cross this threshold, the world system requires more
than incremental improvement in existing techniques of crisis
management. Incremental responses, characteristic of standard
regulation, will be unable to match the exponential speeds of ecological
destruction and technological advancement. This is a fundamental
asymmetry — the speed, scope, and</p>
<p>complexity of the risk landscape dwarfs all current regulation and
response capacities — which must be addressed without succumbing to the
allure of technocratic reaction.</p>
<p>Humanity will need to categorically address the many shadows of its
history, including its tendencies towards violent competition with
out-groups, its exploitation of marginalized classes within in-groups,
and its extractive economic relationship to the earth. This situation
requires that we also fundamentally reimagine our relationship to
technology. More powerful innovations cannot be safely born from market
and military races. Rapid advancement and distribution can no longer be
seen as the mark of progress. If we are to become a wise species, truly
capable of wielding these god-like powers, there must be a transition
and transformation into a culture of technological foresight,
responsibility, and restraint.</p>
<p>To prevent global catastrophes while maintaining important human
freedoms, civilization will require restructuring in recognition of the
generative dynamics underlying the metacrisis. These are the subject of
the following chapters. An understanding of deeper structural causes of
risk, violence, and collapse will serve us in navigating the dark night
of the metacrisis and the uncharted frontier of the future. Greater
clarity will also help in imagining alternative paths to a sustainable
civilization where the relationships between humanity, technology, and
life align, in perpetuity.</p>
