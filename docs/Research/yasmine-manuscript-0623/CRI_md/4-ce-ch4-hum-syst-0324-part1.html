<p>Ch 4: Human Systems Failure</p>
<p>The biosphere-civilization relationship is facing an imminent
transformation, resulting from structural misalignments between the
design of civilization and the realities of the biophysical world. The
underlying causes of ecological overshoot discussed in the previous
chapter are aspects of the “architecture” of global civilization driving
it towards the twin attractors of chaos and oppression. In addition to
those contributing to the environmental crisis, there are several
structural features of civilization which make it vulnerable to <em>human
system failures</em>: (initially defined as) <em>the inability of
safety-critical components of civilization to serve their basic
purpose.</em></p>
<p>When demand for a basic need (such as food, water, energy, shelter,
security from violence) exceeds supply, this is a human system failure.
Risks of this kind include energy grids in a blackout, food
insufficiency, and overwhelmed medical systems and emergency responders.
This category also includes the disruption and decay of essential social
systems such as financial system collapse, corrupted courts, or
congressional gridlock.</p>
<p>There are several fundamental systems in a civilization whose continuous
operations are so basic and essential that they are often taken for
granted, receding into the background of daily life^1^. A partial list
may include e.g., water, energy, and food systems, material supply
chains</p>
<p>^1^ For a relatively exhaustive list of human systems, one may look to a
list of federal institutions. For example, see Selin, Jennifer, L., and
Lewis, David, E. *Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies.
*Administrative Conference of the United States, 2018.</p>
<p>such as in mining, manufacturing, waste management, shipping, and
packaging, travel, communications, technology, emergency response
systems, militaries, and legal, financial, and economic systems. Also
included here are those institutional, cultural, and economic conditions
necessary for guaranteeing basic rights and civil liberties, such as
legal representation, freedom of speech, and access to political
participation.</p>
<p>The components of civilization whose stated purpose is to prevent or
mitigate catastrophic risks — government departments, IGOs, militaries,
non-profits, corporations — are subject to failure from overwhelm,
corruption, and decay. Under the strain of the metacrisis, systems
required for the assurance of safety and the provision of basic needs
and rights will be subject to several compounding pressures such as
shortages of critical materials^2^ and the inability to make sense of
essential social issues — such as pandemics, environmental crises, and
major geopolitical conflicts — due to information overwhelm, the
degradation of trust in media, and escalations in culture wars.^3^</p>
<p>Civilization is not prepared to respond to the growing number of highly
consequential threats, the rate at which we are approaching them, and
the complexity of the overall situation^4^. The primary and defining
concern of the metacrisis, therefore, is that this civilization will
either be unable to prevent global catastrophe, or to do so power and
control will centralize in an oppressive and dystopian fashion to manage
an increasingly chaotic world. We consider both outcomes *human system
failures *of different kinds.</p>

<p>By this definition, most (or all) of the risks discussed in this work
could potentially be seen as human systems failures. Runaway ecological
overshoot and threats from misused artificial intelligence are
catastrophic insofar as they disrupt critical systems for ensuring
safety, health and wellbeing, for example by leading to an inability to
feed people or provide water, security, or medical care. Human systems
failures are highlighted here as a distinct category in order to ensure
comprehensiveness and to foreground certain classes of risk which are
not necessarily covered elsewhere. In the sections which follow, we
elaborate on the various components of civilization subject to failure
and identify how human systems failures could be globally catastrophic
or potentially lead to global civilizational collapse.</p>
<p>Human system failures vary in scale and severity^5^. Some are mere
disruptions and can be responded to relatively quickly. Others can
cascade with global consequences. Others still may offer the possibility
of recovery but where multiple systems failures have cumulative effects
which result in an ultimately, weaker, less adaptive civilization. We
will look at a variety of such system failures, highlighting the most
instructive aspects of this category, and foregrounding the historical
novelty of risks to the human built world in the context of the
metacrisis.</p>

<p>It was mentioned in chapter one that the basic dynamics of civilizations
unfold within superstructures (values, beliefs, and worldviews), social
structures (governance, economies, institutions), and infrastructures
(technologies and material supplies ). This simple three-part model (see
Figure 1) has been used by several generations of social theorists to
describe the different components of civilization. We are borrowing and
refitting it for our purposes. It is elaborated upon below and will be
referred to throughout the remainder of the book.^6^</p>
<p>^5^ See for example, the three distinct but complementary discussions on
global catastrophic risks from Liu, Hin-Yan, Lauta, Kristian, C., and
Maas, Matthjis, M. “Governing Boring Apocalypses: A new typology of
existential vulnerabilities and exposures for existential risk
research.” <em>Futures</em>, 102, (2018):6—19.</p>

10(4), (2019):455—476.</p>
<p>Manheim, D. “The Fragile World Hypothesis: Complexity, Fragility, and
Systemic Existential Risk.”</p>
<p><em>Futures</em>, (2020):122.</p>
<p>^6^ One of the primary formulations of this model that we are using with
significant revisions is from: Harris, Marvin. *Cultural materialism:
The struggle for a science of culture. *New York: Random House, 1979.</p>
<p>To begin, there is <em><strong>infrastructure</strong></em>, those aspects of civilization
involving physical technology deployed to meet human needs. Here occurs
the transformations of energy and matter into things valued by humans.
This includes aspects of civilization such as agriculture, energy,
supply chains, water and sewage systems, transportation systems, waste
management, military installations, communications networks, and so on.
Infrastructure has changed overtime from sailing ships to spaceships,
fire to fission. An exhaustive list of infrastructural components would
be evolving daily in relation to the existing technology stack and
materials economy innovations.</p>
<p>Deeply interconnected with infrastructures are structures that enable
the coordination of people and collective choice making at all scales,
including bureaucratic mechanisms of social integration, legal codes,
economic incentives, governance processes, and contracts. *<strong>Social
Structures</strong> ***can be thought of as formal institutions like those
employed for finance, economics, business, law, and governance. These
are the evolving set of protocols by which we coordinate their
behaviors, codify agreements, constrain disagreements, and integrate
actions to achieve goals.</p>
<p>Interwoven with social- and infra- are <em><strong>superstructures</strong></em>: those
aspects of human social life involved in the creation and maintenance of
cultures, belief systems, mindsets, values, and sense of identity. They
form the basis of cultural epochs, philosophical and scientific
worldviews, ideologies, and qualities of consciousness that characterize
a civilization. Herein lies the processes of shared dialogue and
enculturation which shape a population’s answers to questions of truth,
goodness, and beauty. Superstructures provide meaning to the individuals
living within a civilization, and explain, justify (or critique) the
world around them. As used here, superstructures include beliefs about
what humans should value, in principle, as well as the behaviors that
demonstrate what they actually value, in practice.</p>

<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>In discussions of global catastrophic risk, large-scale infrastructural
failures — such as</p>
<p>nation-wide blackouts or disruption in supply of essential commodities
like grains and medical supplies — appear as the most obvious,
existentially decisive category. Critical infrastructure failure can
directly lead to mass starvation and the inability to receive medical
care.^7^</p>
<p>As put forth here, however, the various layers of civilization are seen
as necessarily interacting and co-influencing. Infrastructure, social
structure, and superstructure are unique but simultaneously
interconnected components of the architecture of civilization (which is
itself embedded in and dependent upon the biosphere). In the previous
chapter, for example,</p>
<p>^7^ For instance, the International Energy Agency wrote, “The potential
indirect impacts of blackouts … include: transport disruption (the
unavailability of trains and charging stations for electric vehicles),
food safety issues (risk to the cold chain), problems related to public
order (crime and riots), and loss of economic activity.”</p>
<p>IEA. <em>Power Systems in Transition</em>. 2020.</p>
<p>civilization was shown to be accelerating beyond planetary boundaries as
a natural consequence of international financial systems requiring
exponential growth (<em>social structure</em>) while operating on a linear
materials economy with increasingly powerful industrial technologies
(<em>infrastructure</em>). Simultaneously present but not mentioned were the
memes and worldviews used to justify such endless growth, to reduce the
value of nature to simple economic metrics, and to support humans’
belief in their separation from, entitlement to, and superiority over
the biosphere (<em>superstructure</em>)^8^.</p>
<p>The social- and superstructural components of a civilization can be
critical driving factors of catastrophic risk without necessarily being
the direct cause of catastrophe on their own.</p>
<p>Financial system failures, institutional decay and dysfunction, and
increases in wealth inequality, for example (all social structural
problems) are historical precursors to civil and inter-state war. Also
consider how cultural conflict, political polarization, and the
degradation of public discourse (superstructural failures) have made it
nearly impossible to agree on the basic realities of a long and growing
list of consequential issues like Covid, AI, and the state of the
biosphere^9^. The inability to make sense of the world makes every other
risk more difficult to address.</p>
<p>The metacrisis involves interactions between these layers of
civilization: the misuse and abuse of increasingly powerful technologies
(infrastructure) driven by a combination of misaligned economic
incentives enabled by overwhelmed or oppressive governments (social
structure), which are sourced in outdated or distorted worldviews and
philosophies of life (superstructure). For this chapter, however, a
comprehensive analysis of risk dynamics across these layers is beyond
scope. The model has been introduced here to frame the following
discussion on human systems, and to provide insight into the extent of
the consideration required to</p>

the empire grew with it, but there was a point when the profits drawn
from internal economic production and external conquest decreased.^11^

increased.^12^ The currency was debased, inflation was rampant.^13^

<p>to decay. The costs of operating the civilization increase, but the
returns slow (ie., diminishing marginal returns). There is increased
corruption, institutional overwhelm, popular discontent, and an
inability to respond to a growing list of challenges.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the first chapter, civilizational growth followed by
collapse has largely been the rule, rather than the exception. Vast,
complex empires have succumbed to disorder and dissolution as their
infrastructures decayed and bureaucracies corrupted, leaving the
civilization as a whole more vulnerable to famines, pandemics, storms,
crime, invaders, uprisings, and civil war. Even the most successful and
sophisticated civilizations transitioned from their phases of growth and
prosperity into periods of decay, decline, and destruction. It is a
recurring pattern for the once functional organs of a society to grow
old, become brittle, and fail to adapt to environmental changes such as
ecosystem degradation^18^, increases or decreases in population, enemy
advancements, or disruptive technologies.</p>
<p>Civilizations can collapse in a variety of ways. Some fall rapidly and
suddenly, in a fit of decadent destruction. These shocking and violent
examples are typically the source of our popular images of collapse; the
sack of the city and the burning of the capital, as depicted in artwork,
stories, and films. Of equal importance, however, is the process of slow
decay. The boring apocalypse as it were^19^. States and civilizations
can die of old age, where the precise cause of death may appear unclear
and the harms are cumulative and hidden.</p>
<p>Social scientists (such as archaeologists, anthropologists, and
historians) have identified several possible causes of civilizational
collapse which can potentially explain the failures of many different
civilizations^20^. One such example is increasing wealth inequality in

<p>diminishing resources. Scarcity increases competition between political
elites. Instead of acting on the basis of a shared worldview for how
civilization should run, there is bitter disagreement and conflict. The
lower and middle classes are then rallied as support bases for competing
causes, which inevitably leads to political gridlock, civil uprisings,
and other systemic failures.</p>
<p>By identifying such patterns, prominent social theorists have made
compelling arguments that Rome collapsed for similar reasons to the
Mayan empire, and that the US Civil War shared similar causes to the
Taiping Rebellion (both of which may share features with the escalation
of political conflict in Western states today)^21^. This chapter won’t
include a detailed discussion of these dynamics, and as a result, there
may be a sense of incompleteness to our discussion until later in the
book in Part two. For now, what is worth keeping in mind is that <em><strong>many
of the dynamics which have led to the rise and fall of past
civilizations are still present today.</strong></em></p>
<p>***The critical difference is that now there is essentially only one,
inescapably global civilization. ***Many apparently separate nations and
cultures have been unified by an intricate and evolving web of
communications, transportation, trade, weapons technologies, military
agreements, and international law. Of course, the failure of one nation
does not inevitably lead to the failure of all others,^22^ but there are
now global systems — such as international agricultural supply chains,
transnational financial institutions and corporations, transoceanic
cables, networks of orbiting satellites, and nuclear weapons
installations — whose functioning affects the fates of all humans and
in some cases all life on earth.</p>
<p>Past civilizations did not critically depend upon one another for their
basic functioning as much as we do today^23^. Collapse in one did not
rapidly cascade into the collapse of others on other continents. But as
humanity advanced through the major phases of industrialization, and
then the development of nuclear and digital technologies, the fates of
every member of the human species (and the biosphere) became
increasingly entangled. Cascading failures across planetary-scale
systems now pose global catastrophic risks. Where famines and pandemics</p>

<p>used to be localized to one regional civilization, potentials now exist
for globally catastrophic events (e.g., billions of people dying of
starvation, a global pandemic, etc.). In its most extreme form, this
would threaten the collapse of the world system (and possibly the
biosphere) as a whole.</p>
<p>Beyond the rare, but very real, potential for imminent world system
shutdown, human system failures can have a range of global consequences
in a global civilization. For example, there is the possibility of a
crisis, such as a pandemic, increasing oppressive regimes around the
world. Crises often also lead to increasing wealth consolidation and
inequality. Moreover, relatively small (not globally catastrophic) human
system failures can continuously increase the cost of operating
civilization, for example, through increases in debt, cost of living,
and inflation.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, this can eventually reach a point of unmanageability and
widespread fragility, creating a massive house of cards upon which we
all depend, requiring only a slight tremor to collapse.</p>

<p>In the 20th century humanity reached a critical point, where the
historical precedent of there being “separate” civilizations was largely
eclipsed.^24^ What we call *global civilization *is unlike any of its
predecessors; itself being composed of several national and cultural
blocs who appear to be functionally independent civilizations. However,
today all nations are inescapably linked, despite their apparent
separation by borders, language, and custom, the prevalence of conflicts
and contradictions between their respective ideologies and political
economies, and their seemingly separate material infrastructures.</p>
<p>For most of history, distinct civilizations such as those in Asia,
Africa, and the Middle East, were interconnected. Complex,
multi-continent trade networks, such as the silk-road, have existed for
thousands of years^25^. For those traveling hundreds of miles for salt
and other resources, these systems of trade were likely seen as
essential. However, when trade failed, it was often possible</p>
<p>^24^ As we’ll see, this is an argument about the now inescapable
interdependence of all humanity. Everyone has become mutually dependent
upon systems that are intrinsically global in nature. For added nuance
on this point see the competing concept of the “civilizational state” —
e.g., in Maçães, Bruno. *The Attack of the Civilizational State. *2020.
and Coker, Christopher. *The Rise of the Civilizational State. *John
Wiley &amp; Sons, 2019.</p>
<p>^25^ Frankopan, Peter. *The Silk Roads: A New History of the World.
*Bloomsbury, 2016.</p>
<p>for local systems (such as those involved in agriculture, water, and
energy) to endure without a great deal of importing and coordination
with other civilizations. Increasing trade and access to other resources
was deeply valued, but not always an immediate, existential necessity.</p>
<p>Eventually, due to increases in trade and technology (for example,
industrialization, telegraph, electricity, nuclear, and eventually
computers and the internet), there was a shift to true interdependence.
It is now commonplace for satisfaction of basic needs to genuinely
depend upon complex systems of coordination spanning six continents.
Here is where the concept of “separate civilizations” begins to lose
credence.</p>
<p>One critical moment in this history was the creation of nuclear weapons,
a rather sudden and decisive factor in unifying global civilization^26^.
Splitting the atom was the first moment in history where humanity truly
was subject to the shared fate of self-induced extinction. Prior to this
there were no choices any humans could make, or systems which could
fail, that would lead to the collapse of all civilizations and the death
of all humans. The potential for a globally shared catastrophe
essentially unified civilization. For the first time, our survival
depended upon coordinated behavior between nuclear armed nations.</p>
<p>The advent of atomic energy was followed by deliberate attempts at
economic globalization, for example, through the creation of the Global
Agreement on Trades and Tariffs (GATT, later renamed the World Trade
Organization, WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World
Bank^27^. This accelerated the historical process of global economic
integration present from the Silk Road to European colonization. The
post-war period was marked by a radical increase in the structural
dependencies and mutual influence between all nations and all peoples,
effectively creating a global civilization.</p>
<p>There are now several interlocking global systems whose sound operation
(or lack thereof) has implications for everyone on earth: energy, food,
nuclear energy and defense, space-based satellites, aviation and
transportation, telecommunications and cyber-infrastructure,
international trade and finance. Also included here are supply chains
for essential resources and</p>

<p>commodities spanning multiple continents like oil, natural gas, grains,
metals, medicine, semiconductors, smartphones, and more.</p>
<p>Many of us depend on systems which are thousands of miles away to
satisfy our basic needs. For example, around 74% of the facilities that
produce active pharmaceutical ingredients used in the United States are
imported from outside of the country.^28^ Healthcare is inherently a
product of global civilization. This is often also true for other
essentials like food and water. For those living in water-scarce
countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Libya, Yemen, or Mexico, for
example, somewhere between 25-50% of the water consumed (mostly via food
and other products which require water in the production process) may
depend on import.^29^ The systems we use to meet our core needs (e.g.,
food, water, medicine) are increasingly spread across the globe, for
better and for worse.</p>
<p>Then there are complex goods such as smartphones, satellites, engines,
and energy infrastructure, which are deeply integrated into our
day-to-day lives, are somewhat inseparable from how we meet our basic
needs, all of which have manufacturing processes involving multiple
nations. For example, a solar panel assembled in China might be designed
by engineers in the United States, using cobalt sourced from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and semiconductors manufactured in
Taiwan. Around 70% of international trade is of this kind, requiring
coordination across multiple continents for a finished product.^30^</p>
<p>Increasing economic interdependence occurs in lock-step with a
corresponding trend of increasing technological dependence. Today’s
global civilization is interwoven with a vast and evolving network of
technologies like smart devices, sensors, satellites, underwater</p>
<p>data-centers, and large GPU clusters^31^. Modern nations depend upon
sophisticated technologies for their basic functioning. Nearly all
critical global systems (weapons, food,</p>

<p>finance, transportation, security, healthcare, energy, media, etc.)
employ advanced technical infrastructure which can only be built through
multi-continent supply chains.</p>
<p>At present, there are very few complex technological products such as
smartphones, solar panels, and satellites whose supply chains live
within a single nation. In some cases, these are technologies which are
potentially essential for ensuring a safe and sustainable future for the
species. Renewable energy technologies are one such example. They depend
upon a suite of metals and minerals such as cobalt, manganese, nickel,
and various other base metals and rare earth elements. All of which are
usually sourced outside of the nation seeking to use them. For example,
70% of the world’s cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of
Congo,^32^ 85% of the global supply of refined rare earth metals is
produced by China, and 94% of the unrefined rare earth metals are also
owned by them .^33^</p>
<p>Despite the reality of nation-state sovereignty, national independence
is, to a certain extent, an illusion — an otherwise convincing
distraction from the inescapable reality of the entanglement of all
humanity. This civilization must be thought of as global due to both the
possibility of</p>
<p>self-induced extinction and the inherently global nature of how humans
are meeting their needs. As we’ll see this has significant implications
for all approaches to civilizational analysis, public policy, and any
efforts to navigate the metacrisis.</p>

these victories have come several problems. For example, they created
the conditions for once local crises to cascade globally, as evidenced
by events like the rapid spread of Covid-19 and the near immediate
supply-chain disruptions following the Ukraine war. In a deeply
interdependent world, failures anywhere can become failures everywhere.</p>
<p>In addition to the immediate impacts of these events were the *second
and third order effects *felt around the world. For example, Covid-19
was followed by the collapse of small businesses, increased food and
employment insecurity, growing distrust in public institutions and
escalating cultural conflict, disruption in education, increases in cost
of living, inflation, wealth consolidation and exacerbating
inequality^35^. These effects did more damage than indicated by the
direct death tolls alone. An additional 97 million people were living in
extreme poverty as a result of</p>
<p>Covid-19, for example^36^. At the same time as much of the population
was driven into increasingly desolate living conditions, massive
economic returns were falling to the world’s wealthiest. It’s estimated
that since 2020, the richest 1% accumulated close to two-thirds of all</p>

USD. The five richest men in the world doubled their wealth and are now

<p>These are examples of the “boring apocalypse.” Here cascading system
failures are not necessarily globally catastrophic, nor do they lead to
civilization collapse, but they do steadily increase the cost of
operating civilization and displace the brunt of the harm to more
vulnerable populations. Over time this lowers quality of life for those
most affected, sows popular discontent, and degrades the ability of
civilization to respond to emerging challenges later down the line. It
is much easier to focus on one, easily observable dimension of a crisis,
such as its immediate death toll. But cumulative decay is death by 1000
cuts, the product of thousands of variables, distributed across regions
and jurisdictions, only observable given dedicated interdisciplinary
study. Civilizational decay is the silent killer, which does not always
receive the attention it is due in conversations of risk, because it is
slower moving and harder to see.</p>
<p>Many discussions of global risk focus on threats from system failure
that could cause planetary-scale catastrophes, collapse, or even
extinction. Such dramatic events are real possibilities. There are
*single points of failure *in systems whose functioning has an outsized
influence on civilization and whose failure would be massively
consequential and potentially very difficult to recover from.</p>
<p>Mistakes and mismanagement of nuclear systems are one clear example.
Nuclear weapon systems can be quite difficult to manage and are not
immune from technical malfunction.</p>
<p>Throughout the Cold War there were thousands of “<em>broken arrow events</em>”
which are where nuclear systems significantly malfunction^39^. For

<p>defense systems falsely warned military officials of imminent nuclear
strikes by the other side. The fate of the species (and possibly the
biosphere) was placed into the hands of individual humans under duress,
forced to make hasty decisions on the basis of faulty information.</p>
<p>Civilization has taken a shape where it is now somewhat normal for the
fates of billions to become the responsibility of a few.</p>
<p>Near-single points of failure also exist in critical supply chains.
Taiwan, for instance, is the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer
and provides nearly 60% of the world’s chips, 90% of the most advanced
ones^40^. Their flagship manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is highly regarded as one of the most
reliable, effective, and efficient manufacturing companies in the world.
Their outsized portion of the market was not a conscious design choice
collectively made by a global civilization seeking to create the most
resilient semiconductor supply chain. Rather, it is a reflection of
TSMC’s asymmetric capabilities as a company in a highly competitive
sector.</p>
<p>TSMC’s success is also widely understood to be a grave source of risk.
Concentrating that much of the world’s manufacturing capability in one
place, in a sector that is fundamental to the success of almost every
other industry and every nation, creates a major vulnerability to
cascading system failure and radically escalates tensions amongst
competing geopolitical powers. The sudden disruption of TSMC’s
operations, for any reason, including extreme weather events or
geopolitical conflict, would undermine our world systems’ expectation of
continued growth and technological advancement. Our civilization depends
upon an increasing supply of semiconductors, both from the desire to
upgrade towards more advanced systems but also the need to replace
degraded chips. Failure of TSMC would therefore be a major disruption to
the basic operations of civilization, likely ushering in a major
financial crisis and drastically shifting the landscape of power.</p>
<p>One way to frame the issue here is in terms of tradeoffs between
efficiency and resilience, which are well known by system designers^41^.
Resilient systems are able to respond, adapt, and preserve or transform
themselves in the face of novel challenges and pressures. This is, in
part,</p>
<p>^40^ Sacks, David. *Will China’s Reliance on Taiwanese Chips Prevent a
War? *Council for Foreign Relations, 2023.</p>
<p>^41^ Manheim, David. “The Fragile World Hypothesis: Complexity,
Fragility, and Systemic Existential Risk.”</p>
<p><em>Futures</em>, 122, (2022):</p>
<p>Also see the discussion of resilience in the classic Meadows, Donella H.
<em>Thinking in systems : a primer.</em></p>
<p>London; Sterling, VA:Earthscan, 2009.</p>
<p>because they have redundancy and diversity with very few single-points
of failure. However, designing for resilience can be costly in the short
term for benefits that may only be realized in the long-term. When faced
with near term competitive pressures, efficiency, cost-effectiveness,
and strategic advantage can be higher priorities. A combination of
market forces and government support (e.g., subsidies, tax breaks, and
bailouts) will select for “economies of scale” where standardization,
the scale of manufacturing, and division of labor increases^42^. This
may significantly optimize company profits, provide strategic advantages
to states, and potentially improve consumer satisfaction, but it can
also lead the overall world system to become more fragile.</p>
<p>The case of TSMC exemplifies how our world system can incentivize single
points of failure in its infrastructure. Selecting for economies of
scale and efficiency over diversity, redundancy, and resiliency, can be
a major driver of human system fragility. The bottom line of system
design is often a complex act of balancing geopolitical and economic
self-interest with public and environmental safety, which in the end
tips the scales away from resilience and towards fragility.</p>
<p>Lastly, even in cases where supply chains are antifragile with
redundancy and multiple suppliers, the underlying infrastructure relies
upon an increasingly fragile and depleted biosphere. To maintain its
current rates of growth and technological advancement, civilization is
extracting from the earth far faster than it can replenish, bringing us
up against <em>diminishing marginal returns</em>: expending more effort and
resources for less rewards in return, needing to run faster simply to
stay in place. In the global energy economy this is known as decreasing
energy return on energy investment (EROI). All of the low hanging fruit
is nearly gone, and we are now transitioning from once abundant, easily
available energy sources to ones which are more difficult and costly to
access^43^. If markets are antifragile in the short-term but are still
misaligned with the biosphere in the long-term, they are merely
displacing risk and fragility into the future.</p>
<p>As global civilization pushes past planetary boundaries, the biosphere
will in turn exert pressure</p>

<p>The world system is growing more complex, externalities are
accumulating, and the consequences of system failure are increasing at
an accelerating rate. There is a widening gap between the complexity and
consequentiality of our problems and the response capacities of
individuals, institutions, and markets. This *capacity crisis^44^ *is a
significant cause of human system failures and a feature shared across
risk categories.</p>
<p>No one is able to take responsibility for the growing number of
catastrophic risks facing humanity. The most concerning threats tend to
fall outside of the jurisdiction of most institutions and governing
bodies, and those institutions tasked with mitigating global
catastrophes are overwhelmed and ill-equipped to do so. The complexity
of the situation is evolving faster than our ability to respond. In part
two we explore what we call <em>regulatory misalignment</em>, a generative
dynamic exploring how governance processes (including through market,
state, nonprofit, and other mechanisms) are less efficient, intelligent,
or adaptable than is needed for the risks they seek to govern.</p>
<p>Everyone living within civilization is affected by the collective
behavior of everyone else, and we are all dependent on the functioning
of the interlocking six-continent systems that support them. In the face
of global catastrophic and existential risks, we all share the same
fate, but it generally seems impossible to reach shared political
agreements (absent coercion) that would respond to the most pressing
issues of our time. Most people, for example, would prefer to</p>

<p>avoid passing planetary boundaries, creating more weapons of mass
destruction, recklessly racing to AGI, extincting countless of species,
decimating the rainforests, subjecting animals to factory farms,
toxifying the oceans, increasing teen suicide, forcing children into
gruesome labor conditions, and murdering thousands in horrific wars. Yet
all of these are generally seen as wicked problems, intractable and
somewhat inevitable. This asymmetry is a major theme of this work and a
driver of human system failure: <em>individuals, nations, and corporations
all contribute to, and in some cases directly cause, global catastrophic
risks, but none of them as individuals, nor the civilization as a whole,
is able to address them^45^</em>.</p>
<p>Today’s global civilization is not the result of a representative sample
of the international community who came together to deliberate and
design an enduringly resilient, sustainable, and ethical civilization.
The world we live in is in large part the unintended outcome of the</p>
<p>high-consequence choices of a relatively small percentage of the
population. Most of the choices made along the way were to satisfy
someone’s near-term strategic interests (be they economic, personal, or
political) — not to support the long-term interests of the species and
biosphere. And this is the self-organizing, self-interested process that
created global civilization, essentially designing it by accident^46^.</p>
<p>Civilization is creating catastrophic risks that no one wants but no one
can stop or escape. *<strong>A world</strong> <strong>that</strong> <strong>no</strong> <strong>one</strong> <strong>consents</strong>
<strong>to</strong> <strong>but</strong> <strong>everyone</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>perpetuating</strong>^47^<strong>.</strong> ***Without
reliable international governance and shared values, it is nearly
impossible to ensure the safe development of new technologies and
facilitate actual responses to global catastrophic risks. Yet
simultaneously, the power of enforcement typically associated with
governments, scaled to the level needed to respond to these existential
challenges, itself poses the parallel concern of global autocratic</p>

<p>^47^ Using the concept of generative dynamics, part two of this
monograph explains why humanity lives in a world with tragedies that
nearly no one wants but no one can seem to stop. One example of this is
the notion of a social trap in which *all actors pursuing their own self
interest cumulatively lead to a worse result for everyone. *This concept
was largely popularized in the existential risk community due to the
blog post on Slate Star Codex titled “Meditations on Moloch.” , where
Moloch - the God of Collective Action Problems - is the answer to the
question ”‘…<em>what does it</em>? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and
wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of
cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their
imagination?’”</p>
<p>control (the subject of chapter eight). This dilemma and dialectic — of
threading the needle between chaos and oppression — is at the heart of
the civilizational design and navigation challenge that is the
metacrisis.</p></article><hr/><div class="page-footer"></div></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div class="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[],&quot;focusOnHover&quot;:false,&quot;enableRadial&quot;:false}"></div><button class="global-graph-icon" aria-label="Global Graph"><svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xml:space="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
