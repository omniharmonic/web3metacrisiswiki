<p>Chapter 7: Violent Conflict</p>
<p>At the dawn of the nuclear age, violent conflict crossed a threshold
into the domain of global catastrophic and existential risk. This was a
profound turning point in history: humanity had invented a technology
powerful enough to pose an immediate threat to all human life. This
initiated a new epoch, characterized by the potential for the imminent
end of the world at any moment from human action. Prior to that moment,
technology arms races forced everyone involved to employ their most
powerful weaponry to win at war. Now for the first time, civilization
was reshaped in an attempt to make sure its most advanced weapons
technology would never be deployed.</p>
<p>Since WWII and the creation of nuclear weapons, there has been a
continuous blurring of lines between: violence and non-violence, war and
peace, weapon and civilian tech, adversary and ally. During this time
there have been no direct wars between major powers, and no further
nuclear strikes since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some view this as evidence
that our civilization has demonstrated progress at addressing the
problem of violence. However, rather than violence disappearing, the
fronts of war were simply changing. Nuclear weapons did not bring about
the end of war; they ushered in an era of <em>war by other means</em>. Bullets
and bombs were supplemented with more hidden means of violence such as
psychological and economic forms. Great powers invested billions in
massive propaganda and cultural influence campaigns as well as espionage
and coordinated interference in the political processes of other
nations. Financial capital, weapons, and training were also poured into
proxy warfare efforts to promote national strategic interests around the
world.</p>
<p>Conflicts between major powers today do not primarily involve the use of
physical force, and targeting an adversary’s military assets. Such
*conventional warfare *still occurs, and given recent escalations in
conflict and massive arms build ups, the likelihood of large-scale
kinetic war between major powers may be increasing. But conventional
violence is not privileged in the way it once was. Today, war manifests
in a more complex fashion: somewhat hidden yet pervasive, not as deadly
as the trenches and the firebombings but equally intent on victory.
Major powers have been actively engaged in *irregular warfare *(also
known as *systemic *or <em>unrestricted warfare</em></p>
<p>*- *see box 2 in the section below)^1^ which includes economic^2^
(sanctions, currency and trade</p>
<p>^1^ In this chapter the terms irregular, unconventional, systemic, and
unrestricted warfare will largely be used synonymously to denote the
difference between a war that seeks to directly defeat an enemy’s armed
forces in battle vs one which indirectly undermines their political will
to fight and uses any means necessary to force them to submit to one’s
interests. These terms are occasionally used differently in the defense
literature. Our choice to use them as synonyms is largely stylistic and
justified in part by their many overlapping definitions. For more
understanding of the potential differences amongst terms, see below.</p>
<p>The US Department of Defense (2020) defines “irregular warfare” as “a
struggle among state and non-state actors to influence populations and
affect legitimacy.” This is a form of warfare that “favors</p>
<p>indirect and asymmetric approaches”. Some analysts have also taken an
expanded definition of the term, such as “activities short of
conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s
influence and legitimacy, as well as to weaken its adversaries (Jones,
2021). Our approach here is closer to the latter definition.</p>
<p>“Unrestricted warfare” was a term coined by Colonels Qiao Liang and Wang
Xiangsui in a book of the same name, and denote the evolution of war
towards <em>using all means, including armed force or</em></p>
<p><em>non-armed force, military and non-military, and lethal and non-lethal
means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interests.</em></p>
<p>Less often used is “systemic warfare”, which can be taken to mean
involving attacks on financial systems, creating dependent regions and
peoples, mass participation in anti-state activity, cyber operations,
selective bio-attacks and attacks on food, water and energy
infrastructure (Johnson, 2014).</p>
<p>Although there is no universally agreed definition, “Conventional”, or
equivalently “traditional” warfare, generally refers to a form of war
between states and their militaries where the objective is to defeat the
adversary’s armed forces, or seize and retain territory (Department of
Defense, 2017). “Unconventional” warfare in US joint doctrine is defined
as activities which are conducted to enable</p>
<p>resistance movements or insurgencies to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a
government or occupying power. This is usually a key part of irregular
warfare strategy (US Army Special Operations Command, 2016).</p>
<p>The above terms are also closely related to theories and debates in
conflict research regarding generations of warfare.
Conventional/traditional warfare generally relates to the first three
generations, unconventional warfare typifies fourth generation, and
unrestricted warfare characterizes fifth generation warfare (Osinga,
2006; Reed, 2008; Krishnan, 2022).</p>

<p>conflict, price gouging, etc.), supply chain^3^ (export controls,
resource dominance), cyber^4^ (attacks within the digital domain and all
of the critical infrastructure which depends upon it), political^5^
(coercive diplomacy), psychological and population-centric^6^
(large-scale manipulation via propaganda and information campaigns), and
proxy warfare^7^. The goal is similar to conventional war: the use of
coercive means to acquire something of political or strategic value,
such as economic, geographical, or military advantage^8^. However, in
the presence of massively asymmetric and existentially destructive
military power, direct conflict was sublimated into more indirect forms.
Rather than full frontal attack and annihilation, competitors employ all
means at their disposal to manipulate the adversary to submit to their
interests.</p>
<p>A profound line in history was drawn when nuclear weapons were created.
The difference between the pre-atomic and atomic age was so significant
that the entire system of international politics was restructured as a
result. We are at another moment of similar magnitude, which is also
vastly more complex and unstable (see table 1). We are developing and
disseminating new types of weapons with global catastrophic potential,
but many of these do not require the same access to novel materials and
major nation state level engineering needed as for nuclear tech^9^.</p>

<p>With increasingly powerful, increasingly available technologies, nation
states are not the only groups to consider when thinking about globally
catastrophic violence^10^. Non-state actors have become much more
relevant. This includes a range of agents with very different means and
motivations such as lone-actors (like a disenfranchised, or sadistic,
shooter or bomber), international criminal organizations (ICOs), and
groups driven to violence by a variety of religious and political
ideologies. In a deeply unstable planetary situation, more and more
people will be driven to take radical action, including violence, as a
result of genuinely dire circumstances such as the hundreds of millions
of refugees whose homes and lives will be lost in the next decade from
environmental catastrophe.</p>
<p>With advanced technology, more actors are able to cause catastrophic
violence for many different purposes. Cartels and ICOs now challenge
(and collude with) national militaries and police forces, patrolling
cities in armored vehicles with automatic weapons and rocket launchers
as they traffic drugs, weapons, and people^11^. Radicalized ex-military
groups have disrupted critical civilian infrastructure by cutting
fiber-optic cables and executing precision attacks on transformer
stations with assault rifles^12^. Hackers have successfully shut down
pipelines, major dams, and even nuclear systems^13^. Both state and
non-state actors are equipping cheap</p>
<p>^10^ This is well known in the security community. For an introductory
discussion, see Homer Dixon, Thomas. *The Rise of Complex Terrorism.
*Foreign Policy, 2009.</p>
<p>^11^ There has been a widespread increase in the use of military force
and militarized police against ICOs, particularly in Latin America. The
level of violent conflict has been qualified by legal and security
experts as equivalent to non-international armed conflicts (Kalmanovitz,
2022).</p>
<p>There is also an ongoing debate whether organized crime falls under the
provisions of international humanitarian law due to collusion with State
and non-State actors, and the blurry line between economically motivated
ICOs and politically motivated non-State armed actors (Muggah, 2023).</p>

infrastructure (Whyte &amp; Mazanac, 2023).</p>
<p>The 2010 Stuxnet attack against Iran damaged over a thousand centrifuges
at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility and was described as the “most
technologically sophisticated malicious program developed for a targeted
attack to date”, marking an evolution in cyberwarfare operations
(Lindsay, 2013). In 2021, Colonial Pipeline Co., the biggest oil
pipeline company in the U.S. was hit by a ransomware attack which forced
a week-long shut down the Colonial Pipeline (which provides 100 million
gallons of fuel a day) for the first time in fifty-seven years,
resulting in a localized fuel shortage, concluding with a ransom payout
of over 4.4 million dollars.</p>

<p>wealthiest people in the world have higher net worths than the GDP of
~184 nations^19^. When a major percentage of the population is under
near-constant stress to satisfy basic needs, and they can clearly see
incredible amounts of wealth being accumulated by others, an increased
willingness to be violent appears inescapable. Rampant inequality is
both ethically concerning and existentially risky when one realizes,
desperation and radicalization are increasing just as vastly more
powerful technologies are being distributed to the broader population,
i.e., <em>decentralized catastrophe weapons</em>.^20^</p>
<p>The willingness to be violent and the underlying drivers of conflict
have not gone away. The motivation remains, the means have changed, and
the potential for harm has radically increased. Through innovation in
nuclear capabilities and other advanced military technologies, the total
destructive energy available for future kinetic war is trillions-fold
greater than it has ever been before^21^. In the grand scheme of
history, 80 years is but a moment, and whether or not a brief lack of
globally catastrophic violence will prove enduring is definitely not
certain. In 2022, deaths in armed conflicts around the world doubled,
largely due to the most significant land war in Europe since 1945^22^.
The total number of armed conflicts worldwide has also been on a steady
upward trend over the last two decades^23^. Whether or not these trends
lead to</p>

<p>^23^ Uppsala Conflict Data finds that state based violence increased
from 33 conflicts in 2001 to 56 conflicts in 2021, and non-state
violence up from 41 conflicts in 2001 to 84 conflicts in 2021.</p>
<p>They define a state-based armed conflict as “a contested incompatibility
that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force
between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state,
results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year.”</p>
<p>Similarly, a non-state conflict is defined as “the use of armed force
between two organised armed groups, neither of which is the government
of a state, which results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a
year.”</p>
<p>escalations akin to the previous world wars is now a live question, with
an answer unknowable at this time. We can appreciate the avoidance of
direct, kinetic super-power conflict on one level while acknowledging
that the world system which enabled the “post-war peace” has reached its
end and left a vastly more dangerous world in its wake.</p>
<p>Tensions between major powers are increasing. Technology races are
intensifying. Nuclear systems are improving. Today’s multipolar nuclear
world (where multiple nations wield strategic arsenals) is young and
deeply unstable^24^. Civilization is now passing critical ecological
limits — placing constraints on future economic growth^25^. After WWII,
many in the political leadership class argued that increasing free trade
and global economic growth would usher in an era of peace^26^. But
economic globalization merely transformed direct kinetic war between

<p>^26^ At the beginning of the 20th century, prior to the first world war,
a best-selling book by Norman Angell, *The Great Illusion *(G.P.
Putnam’s Sons, 1910) argued that the economic cost of war was becoming
so great that it was irrational to believe war was profitable. The book
gained a great deal of popular support, and Angell later received the
Nobel Peace prize for these and other ideas.</p>
<p>The Great Depression and hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic following
WWI are often considered relevant precursors to WWII, as discussed, for
example, in Steil, Benn. <em>The Battle of Bretton Woods</em>. Princeton

<p>See also Irwin, Douglas, Mavroidis, Petros, and Sykes, Alan. “The
Genesis of the GATT.” *Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. *(2008).</p>
<p>The exact relationship between trade and violence is a contested debate
which we need not hold a definitive position on. What is relevant for
our purposes is that there is evidence and reason to believe that
increased economic interdependence contributed to a decrease in
violence, at least in the immediate period following WWII. More
importantly, however, is that this position was held by prominent
officials of</p>
<p>powers into a war against nature. If globalization decreased direct
conflict between major powers in the short term, ecological overshoot is
likely to increase violence as a whole in the long term. Extreme weather
events continue to increase in frequency and severity.</p>
<p>Unprecedented refugee crises and their associated political tensions are
imminent, and the likelihood of resource conflict is growing (e.g.,
between China, India, and Pakistan, three highly populated, nuclear
powers sharing the dwindling Himalayan Watershed)^27^.</p>
<p>Ballooning military budgets and all-out arms races do not indicate that
major powers are preparing for peace. They reflect a radical escalation
in geopolitical tensions and preparation for conflict. Current global
military expenditure has increased tenfold since 1949. Global military
spending in 2023 was an estimated $2.2 trillion (roughly 40% of which
was from US military spending alone), around 10x higher than the
build-up prior to WWII, and 100x more than before WWI (adjusted for
inflation)^28^. Major powers continue to build deep underground military
bases</p>

<p>^27^ There is strong empirical research to support the link between
resource scarcity (and abundance) to violent conflict (Vesco et al.
2020). Climate change and further degradation of natural resources has
also been shown to increase risk of violent conflict (Levy, 2019;
Onuoha, 2023). The Great Himalayan Watershed is one region which has
received significant attention from International Relations scholars as
an ongoing site of water resource conflict between India, Pakistan and
China (see Davis et al. 2021 for a critical examination).</p>

(2021) for global military expenditure, we can compare with military
spending prior to the two world wars. World military</p>
<p>to survive a nuclear blast — pouring billions of dollars into
post-apocalyptic infrastructure^29^, for a reason. They are equipping
their arsenals with missiles that can travel at hypersonic speed with
multiple reentry vehicles; where a missile can evade radar detection
until much later and deliver multiple warheads to several targets at
once, making anti-missile defense nearly impossible.</p>
<p>With the help of airborne command and control centers, we are even
prepared to fly above the mushroom clouds and operate our militaries in
the midst of nuclear war^30^. The risk of nuclear conflict is greater
than any point during the Cold War. As of 2025, the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists’ *Doomsday Clock *is set to 89 seconds to midnight, the
closest to global catastrophe it has ever been^31^.</p>
<p>Since the Cold War, civilization has been in an ongoing state of
planetary-scale, irregular warfare. As a result, it has occasionally
seemed as if we had been relatively successful at curbing violence, and
its historical cycles of bloody conflicts. However, today we are
witnessing a resurgence of major power competition and preparation for
large-scale conflict, taking place at</p>
<p>expenditure in 1913 prior to WW1 was ~$30B USD (1980). Adjusting to
2021, this is about $98B USD, so current military spending is 2 orders
of magnitude greater than pre-WW1 military buildup. Similarly, world
military expenditure in 1938 (the year before WW2) was $127B USD
(1980), which is about $418B USD (2021), still an order of magnitude
less than current expenditure.</p>

<p>a time when there is more destructive and dystopian weaponry than at any
point in history. As more nations gain nuclear capability, advanced
technologies become widely distributed, and civilization passes critical
ecological limits, the system of geopolitical power becomes increasingly
unstable, competitions over resources and positions of political
influence escalate, and the likelihood of globally catastrophic violence
grows. An imminent sense of insecurity then drives us to create
increasingly invasive systems of surveillance and control, posing the
counter-risk of a high-tech, all-encompassing, planetary police state.</p>

<p>The existence of world-ending weaponry and asymmetric military forces
brought about a shift from primarily engaging in conventional forms of
violence to the use of irregular tactics (see box 2). At first this was
primarily driven by the US and USSR seeking to weaken one another
without engaging in direct kinetic warfare. Conventional tactics were
enveloped within a broader strategy of economic and financial coercion,
political interference and regime change, espionage, intelligence
gathering, proxy-conflict, insurgency, terrorism, cyber-attacks, and
information and population centric warfare. In parallel, smaller nations
and non-state actors (e.g., in Vietnam and Afghanistan) were also
innovating in irregular tactics in order to contend with these more
powerful, nuclear-armed militaries (often in the midst of the proxy wars
taking place between them). By means of insurgency, guerilla warfare,
and decentralized organization, these groups were able to drive up the
economic and political costs of war too high for major powers to bear,
forcing withdrawal.</p>
<p>Irregular warfare is not totally unprecedented. As long as humans have
fought, military tactics have involved means such as disrupting an
enemies economy by cutting off their supply chains, or undermining their
political system with propaganda and misinformation. What is novel is
the scale of irregular conflict and the power of technologies being
used. It is not an overstatement to say that the entire world system has
been pulled into and affected by unrestricted warfare. The battlefield
is everywhere, very few aspects of the human experience are left
unscathed, and the “casualties” are highly consequential without always
being immediately obvious. Where Sun Tzu and other historical masters of
war worked largely at the local level (up to multi-continent empires),
today state and non-state actors are running more advanced strategies at
truly global scale. The reality of planetary-scale, ubiquitous,
unrestricted warfare is that humanity is in a state of perpetual war.
There has been an end to the notion of “peace-time.” The conditions of
nearly all of civilization are partially influenced by large-scale
coordinated warfare.</p>

there is historical precedence for militarization of cloud seeding as in
Project Popeye during the Vietnam War (Fleming, 2010), the Environmental
Modification Convention (ENMOD) treaty prohibits the military use of
environmental modification (including weather modification) techniques.
This being said, there are emerging security concerns around cloud
seeding programs, particularly in east Asia (Shevchenko, 2021).</p>

<p>Directing attention towards an apparent decrease in conventional warfare
between major powers has diverted focus from the escalation in
intensity, scope, and impact of unrestricted conflict. Harms from an
irregular war are often subtle forms of societal erosion as opposed to a
direct body count. A useful analogy here is the medical distinction
between morbidity and mortality. The consequences of unrestricted
warfare look more like an increasingly morbid civilization — one which
is disease ridden but not yet dead. A successful irregular campaign, for
instance, might leave the enemy’s population with unbound economic
inequality, rampant political corruption, and widespread drug addiction.
And, of course, such tactics are vastly more effective when they leave
no trace of being an act of war in the first place.</p>

<p>Now this is not to say that direct casualties have not played a role in
the last 80 years of irregular conflict. The brunt of the death toll has
just mostly been borne by those in South America, South East Asia, the
Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Africa — all caught in the midst of
proxy war. From 2001 to 2024 there has been a 304% increase in violent
events, and a 208% increase in fatalities, in intra- and inter-state
conflict^86^. Nearly all of these (e.g., in the Eastern Congo, Mali,
Somalia, Colombia, Afghanistan, Northern Pakistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen,
and the Ukraine) involve larger powers (the US, Britain, France, Saudi
Arabia, Israel, Iran, Russia, or China) who provide military aid,
weapons, training, and logistical support to their group of choice.
State and non-state actors fighting in regional wars have become
strategic investments — *irregular assets *— in the portfolios of
major powers.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon in proxy warfare for aid to be provided to a group
whose interests overlap with a state’s for a short period of time but
which eventually diverge. Once a rebel group or “freedom fighter” is no
longer useful, they may just as easily be classified as a terrorist^87^.
This then requires further military engagement, justifies increases in
defense spending and perpetuates the cycle of violence and the
associated accumulation of profits and power.^88^ When a state funds
another actor to support their interests, they are exploiting a
strategic loophole: the ability to move their agenda forward at a
distance, with the possibility to pull out when it does not suit them,
all the while maintaining plausible deniability for the harms caused by
their</p>

<p>proxies and lowering risk of backlash from the international
community^89^. Who is responsible for a humanitarian atrocity or war
crime, the rogue rebel group who pulls the trigger or anyone who has
ever given them capital, weapons, or training? In unrestricted warfare
this ambiguity is viewed as a strategic opportunity, capitalized upon by
states who employ non-state actors (including terrorist networks^90^,
private security corporations^91^, and international criminal
organizations^92^) to achieve their ends.</p>
<p>The prevalence of private security and military corporations (PSMCs) has
skyrocketed within recent years^93^. Major powers may make use of PSMCs
as much or more than their own militaries. Between one-third to one-half
of $14 trillion dollars spent by the Pentagon since the war in
Afghanistan went to military contractors^94^. In 2007 during the US-Iraq
war, there were around 160,000 private contractors employed in Iraq,
roughly equivalent to the number of official US troops there at the
time^95^. PSMCs such as Academi (formerly known as Blackwater) or the
Wagner group are used by major powers to aid in every dimension of
warfare: combat, guarding and protection, detention and interrogation,
wargaming, field training, logistics, propaganda campaigns, mission
critical support, and post-invasion occupation. One of the many benefits
of hiring a PSMC is that they operate with a great deal of legal
ambiguity. Some of the worst war crimes in recent history have been
carried out by military contractors, but prosecution is difficult</p>

<p>and rare as the international legal status of PSMCs remains unclear^96^.
They may be granted certain forms of legal immunity by the state they
are employed within, and pose little liability to the foreign government
enlisting their services. When things go wrong, the state can displace a
great deal of the responsibility and repercussions to the company.
Governments are also not PSMCs’ only customers. Whoever has sufficient
funds can make use of their elite military forces for any purpose
imaginable while remaining in a legal gray zone with minimal
accountability.</p>
<p>International criminal organizations (ICOs) are another non-state actor
that can be engaged in service to state interests. ICOs exist within the
illicit economy of cybercrime (e.g., ransomware), financial extortion,
and drug, weapons, and human trafficking. They operate with paramilitary
forces who rival the militaries of small nations and police in terms of
power. In 2017 ICOs killed about as many people as the combined death
tolls of all other armed conflicts around the world^97^. States may see
strategic value in an ICOs’ activities even if they are not willing to
explicitly engage in them. For example, a nation may turn a blind eye to
its cybercriminals if their attacks weaken an adversary^98^. Or they may
offer direct or indirect support for drug trafficking with the knowledge
that it will poison the enemy’s population; for example, selling the
chemical precursors of fentanyl to Mexican cartels who then produce and
traffic the drug across the US border^99^. Fentanyl overdoses accounted

<p>Indirect casualties in irregular conflict have characteristically blurry
lines of responsibility and harm attribution, and the strategic targets
are not limited to military personnel^102^. The battlefield has
continuously moved further and further into civilian territory. Everyday
citizens (including children) and basic social structures are equally as
likely to become targets in broader efforts to create political
instability.</p>
<p>The motivation towards violence did not evaporate when major powers
realized they had to avoid total war with one another. They just
sublimated it into unconventional warfare between one another, a war
against nature, and conventional violence against smaller nations. When
local governments were not amenable to the policies or political
ideologies of the larger power, they were often implemented by
unbearable economic pressure or by force via armed militant groups who
overthrew the existing political regime^103^. This took place regardless

<p>^103^ A dataset compiled by O’Rourke (2020) found that there have been
sixty-four US-backed covert regime changes - ten times more than the six
overt regime changes. Covert tactics include: assassinating foreign
leaders; sponsoring coups d’état; covertly meddling in foreign
elections; aiding, funding, and arming anti-government dissident groups;
and attempting to incite popular revolutions.</p>
<p>By contrast, overt regime changes involve operations which publicly
acknowledge the use of military force to replace the political
leadership of another state. Overt military actions include air strikes
aimed at leadership decapitation or limited invasions to remove foreign
leaders.</p>
<p>More generally, the most frequent goal of international economic
sanctions is regime change and democratization, however these tend to be
less effective and often backfire (Oechslin, 2014; Weyland, 2018; Djuve

<p>not it required grave human rights abuses and left the country in a
state of chaos. Intelligence circles and policy think tanks have long
known that these kinds of political practices increased the likelihood
of terrorism and violent radicalization^104^. Political instability and
economic stagnation in the presence of massive wealth inequality foster
ethnic, ideological and religious extremism and the violence that
accompany them. Violent groups must draw new members from the wider
community they live within, and the foreign policies of larger nations
(such as those involving aerial bombings, civilian casualties, regime
change, occupation, and economic exploitation) are major recruiting
devices^105^. The attitudes of local citizens towards terrorist</p>

<p>more groups seeking to shape the world in their favor: major states
resorting to force to resolve territorial disputes^108^, revolutionaries
usurping governments they perceive as illegitimate^109^, religious
groups waging holy wars, PSMCs and ICOs pursuing profit, and political
radicals of any kind promoting their preferred ideology. Generally
someone will only resort to violence if they have a reason to do so
(<em>motivation</em>), weapons (<em>means</em>), and knowledge of how to use them
(<em>method</em>). All three of these are increasing across the board for a
greater portion of the general population: <em><strong>more individuals and
groups are willing and able to be violent given exponentially advancing
technology and in some cases professional military training</strong></em>.</p>

<p>When assessing risks from violence, the intensification of irregular
warfare foregrounds the importance of understanding *Realpolitik
*perspectives.^110^ Someone is considered to be *Realpolitik *when they
prioritize practical and strategic concerns over ideological and ethical
commitments. In such cases the main motive of behavior is not to promote
the virtues of democracy or communism, it is to enact strategically
favorable policies that protect your interests. Kinetic warfare is then
simply only one of several possible ways to do so.^111^ Military power
is an instrument of power — there are many others including economic,
bureaucratic, technological, and ideological forms. From a realpolitik
perspective, power is primary. Politics is thus viewed to be a system
whose behavior is governed by laws of power much like the natural world
is governed by laws of physics. While not all military and political
actors view the world in</p>

<p>^111^ To paraphrase the famous Prussian military strategist Carl von
Clausewitz: <em>war is politics by other means</em>.</p>
<p>this way, it is clear from a study of history that many do^112^. We risk
gravely misunderstanding reality when we turn a blind eye to people’s
willingness to resort to violence in pursuit of power.</p>
<p>As a political or military official, if you believed a war would be of
greater benefit than cost, why would you not initiate it? The history of
empire expansionism reveals that many leaders considered their conquests
in terms of a cold cost-benefit calculus^113^. This way of thinking can
appear alien and unfamiliar to those who view war as an unspeakable
tragedy, only to be pursued as a last resort in self-defense or in
response to a true (non-fabricated) humanitarian atrocity. From the
broader public’s perspective, sacrificing your people’s lives for mere
political gain is never worth it. But for those who have initiated
unnecessary (i.e., largely strategically motivated) wars throughout
history, casualties only mattered in so far as they harmed political
ambitions more than they helped them (e.g., a war can depopulate your
army, lower your tax base, diminish chances of reelection, risk civil
uprising, etc.). Whoever initiates a war is less likely to die in
it^114^, and if they win, they grow in power, write themselves into the
history books as the righteous victor, and rule an empire with greater
riches. “<em>War is a racket. The few profit, the many pay</em>.”^115^ <em>For
those who are motivated by the profits, it is more absurd to abstain
from war than to engage in it.</em></p>

<p>There has never been a shortage of virtuous reasons to go to war.
Justifications are always in demand — and always in supply — to bridge
the gap between the public’s view of war (i.e., not wanting to
sacrifice their family, friends, and children) and the realpolitik view
of war (i.e., as a strategic opportunity). War is typically sold to the
people as if it is of the utmost ethical and existential consequence,
even when this is later shown to have been based in falsehoods^116^.
Under assumptions of realpolitik, we should always be dubious of public
statements promoting peace, freedom, liberty, democracy, equality, and
workers rights when they are used to justify acts of violence. Wherever
violence is put forth as the best means of ensuring essential values,
skepticism is warranted .</p>
<p>Honest discussions of violence force us to confront the darker aspects
of human experience, which we often seek to avoid. We are quick to cast
harmful behaviors into the shadows when we ignore our own and others’
willingness to be violent, and all of the ways this civilization assumes
violence for its very existence. Most (nearly all) of our activities
depend upon energy sources (e.g., oil) and commercial products (e.g.,
digital technology) that depend upon supply chains established on the
basis of wars with egregious civilian casualties, child and slave labor,
and environmental destruction. In a civilization that is mediated
through systemic violence, our dependence upon it pushes us to be
complacent and conditions us to turn a blind eye. But violence is not
resolved through ignorance. It continues to exist, just hidden from
immediate view.</p>
<p>Moral constraints against violence should not be taken as a given, not
in nature and certainly not in politics. Psychopathic and sadistic
psychologies exist. There is a portion of the population who does not
feel empathy or remorse for harm, and even takes pleasure in it. While
it is a relatively small percentage of the population that enjoys
torture in the way Ghengis Kahn did, it is likely a higher percentage of
those who rise the ranks of political and military hierarchies. The
demographics that share these antisocial personality traits are often
both deeply drawn to power and disproportionately skillful in its
games^117^.</p>
<p>^116^ There are countless historical examples here but in recent memory
is the public statement that Iraq was developing weapons of mass
destruction</p>

<p>Those willing to wage unnecessary wars only refrain from violence if
there is a better means of achieving their goals. They do not naturally
prioritize mutually beneficial outcomes. Compromise comes when it offers
something of greater benefit than mere self-interest, such as increasing
wealth through trade or economic growth (which is reaching its limits as
civilization pushes past the planet’s). Or if there is threat of
comparable violence in return, “peace” may be preferred as the most
rational outcome. This principle is well known in political theory,
where protection from violence, and its legally sanctioned use, are seen
as the defining function of the “state”---that political body which
serves as a “legitimate” monopoly on the use of force. It is also why
the development of nuclear weapons remains such a significant motivator
and driver of geopolitical tension: the technology is powerful enough
that any nation with a nuclear stockpile has meaningfully leveled the
playing field.^118^</p>

<p>Technological shifts have completely upended the security environment in
the past and are doing so again today. Radically empowered after WWII
and being the first nation to develop and deploy atomic weapons, the US
found itself in a position of massive asymmetric political influence. We
are once again in the midst of profound technological change — a
revolution with AI and computation at the center driving the compounding
advancement of every sector such as biotech, robotics, IoT, and
manufacturing. This wave will be at least as consequential as nuclear.
Many actors (state and non-state alike) are hoping to leverage this
opportunity, to strategically make use of the potential of advanced
technologies to restructure civilization and its systems of power. The
stakes of technological supremacy are high, radically increasing the
speed, intensity, and consequentiality of power competition.</p>
<p>^118^ Kenneth Waltz argues that those who are threatened by American
Imperialism know that weapons of mass destruction are the only means to
deter the US, therefore leading to proliferation of WMDs. Booth, K.,
Dunne, T. (2002). *Worlds in Collision: Terror and the Future of Global
Order. *Palgrave Macmillan.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence, most importantly, has become the new crown
jewel of geopolitics. AI arms races are now a primary driver of global
conflict, ^119^ leading some prominent technologists like Elon Musk, to
claim that the “competition for AI superiority at a national level is
the most likely cause of WWIII…”^120^ Trillions in investment are
being poured into winning this race, and as “chip bans” and monopolies
over rare earth mines demonstrate, serious efforts are being made to
stop anyone else from getting there first. By engineering at the level
of intelligence itself, AI seeks to transform every domain of human
action, enabling much more than autonomous weapons alone. It is the
quintessential omni-use technology and will advance, amplify, and
exacerbate every tactic of conventional and unconventional warfare.</p>
<p>Cyber-operations will grow in scale and sophistication with AI coding
assistance and automated vulnerability detection. Military targeting is
transforming with planetary-scale surveillance using facial recognition
software run on drone, satellite, and “internet of things” data.
Companies like Anduril are rapidly advancing autonomous weapons,
integrating several military systems into a single intelligent web:
fighter jets, tanks, cruise missiles, small arms, surveillance systems,
and drones, all coordinated via a common AI “brain” called Lattice. This
system, according to founder Palmer Luckey, is comparable to “Sky-Net,”
the intelligent weapons system that went rogue in the famous sci-fi
movie, the Terminator. AI augmentation of war is well underway. Other
companies such as Palantir are also actively employing large-language
models and other machine learning techniques into full-stack warfare:
monitoring the battlefield, identifying adversaries, offering
intelligent situational assessment, suggesting tactics, and automating
communications and troop deployment^121^.</p>
<p>AI is also radically advancing research and engineering in the natural
sciences — discovering the first novel antibiotic in over 60 years and
also inventing 40,000 new chemical weapons in just under six hours^122^.
AI enabled financial systems, like Black Rock’s Aladdin platform, manage
nearly as much capital as the GDP of the United States and are essential
tools in every aspect of financial warfare (e.g., currency and trade
war). Deep-fake capabilities have advanced to such a point that video,
audio, and personality can be faked in real time to scam people into</p>

<p>transferring capital or providing compromising material of any kind.
LLMs will also likely be used to disrupt the political system, e.g., in
the form of autonomous legislation drafting, loophole identification,
and legal argumentation. Though each of these use-cases may initially
involve distinct kinds of AI architectures, the tech industry as a whole
is rapidly moving towards increasingly general intelligence. Every
technique in unrestricted warfare will be advanced and potentially
automated. The omni-use potential of this technology has radically
intensified a global arms race to capture the “one ring to rule them
all.”</p>
<p>Contemporary technology races are structurally different from nuclear
arms races. They are vastly more complex, seemingly intractable,
accelerating at a faster rate, with consequences of equal existential
significance. This is in large part because advanced technologies, like
AI, are vastly more difficult to contain and control than nuclear
weapons. The immense difficulty of manufacturing nuclear weapons
initially limited them to only a few major state actors who could be
relatively easily monitored. However, the technologies required for
cyberweapons, drones, biological, chemical, autonomous, and population
centric weapons can be developed and deployed by vastly more state and
nonstate actors. As mentioned in the previous chapter, unlike nuclear,
the cutting edge of technology is not exclusively coming from weapons
innovation but from civilian technology, which can then be exploited by
all kinds of actors for all kinds of purposes. Emerging innovations are
advancing in the military and commercial sector, across many industries,
and in many countries. This includes ongoing, active development by a
massive open source community, many of whom are technically
sophisticated and who also greatly value anonymity and employ advanced
cryptography to protect it. <em><strong>Advanced technologies are escalating
tensions between major powers while they are simultaneously distributing
the capacity for globally consequential violence outside of the agency
of nation states</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Non-state actors, such as terrorist networks and criminal organizations,
are becoming increasingly capable of imposing massive costs onto larger
actors like national militaries and governments. The most powerful
military in the world was unable to comprehensively defeat insurgencies
who were primarily using road bombs and suicide bombers. With
technological advances and decreasing costs the barrier to entry for
large-scale destruction will only continuously get lower. A technically
minded terrorist with internet access can now be armed with
technological power that would have ten years ago been prohibitively
costly, only accessible to well-resourced militaries. Controlling the
decentralization of weapons was always</p>
<p>difficult, but as these technologies become cheaper and more widely
available, preventing their harmful applications becomes nearly
impossible.</p>
<p>Weaponizable drones are commercially available, and the swarming and
object recognition algorithms are accessible with open source code:
autonomous assassins — *slaughter bots *— and AI-drone enabled
infrastructure attacks are not the sole privilege of nation-state
militaries.</p>
<p>Similarly, customizable bioweapons can be made with a benchtop DNA
synthesizer costing as little as $25,000, assembled with detailed
instructions provided by open source and jailbroken LLMs. It is
relatively well known at this point that generative AI content and deep
fakes can create personalized propaganda and misinformation campaigns at
scale. Less well understood, however, is how these same technologies can
lead to other critical human systems failures like causing a run on a
bank with false images of crowds withdrawing money, fake reports of the
banks low deposits, further backed by the posts of fictitious clients’
on online forums. In unrestricted warfare, smaller actors must employ
any means necessary. Nothing is off limits, and omni-use technologies
enable omni-directional attacks.</p>

<p>When considering planetary-scale irregular warfare, major transnational
technology companies (such as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI,
Anthropic, Meta, Palantir, Anduril, Musk Industries [Tesla, xAI,
SpaceX], Nvidia, BlackRock, etc.) are at least as relevant as the G20
or any other non-state actor like terrorist networks and ICOs. The total
technological capability and financial capital of the top 20 companies
are far beyond most nation-states. The market caps of the top seven
companies in the world are worth more than the GDP of 150 different
nations.</p>
<p>They all have deca-billion dollar technical infrastructures that rival
or exceed major militaries: including advanced communication systems,
data-centers, gpu-clusters, manufacturing capabilities, energy plants,
IoT systems, and satellites. Nearly all of the top companies are leaders
in AI, advancing multiple applications and cognitive architectures as
well as robotics, sensors, and biotech — usually with the ambition to
move towards increasingly general (or super) intelligent systems.</p>
<p>Most G20 countries profoundly depend upon these companies to function.
Government services are run on Amazon’s cloud computing infrastructure
or over Starlink’s communication channels.</p>
<p>The US intelligence apparatus — for example, the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI,
CDC, SOC, etc — heavily relies on Microsoft’s GovTech suite and
Palantir’s software services. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is responsible for 50%
of all orbital operations globally and 80% of the weight brought into
space every year in the US. Given the company’s monopoly on
space-flight, <strong>the US military is fundamentally dependent upon them for
essentially all of their space activity</strong>.</p>
<p>Corporate entities do not function as democracies. They are completely
top-down hierarchical structures beholden to shareholders, not the
broader public. Leading CEOs tend to be students of the art of war who
have studied unconventional tactics and engage in them to advance their
own objectives year over year. Major companies regularly pressure nation
states to submit to their interests by choosing where they will operate
or by threatening to remove access to critical services (e.g., Starlink
Services in the Ukraine). Lawfare is a norm amongst the biggest actors
who employ the best, most expensive firms to fight anyone (other
companies, public institutions, or other nations) who proves to be an
obstacle to their goals. The major players are masters of shaping public
opinion via massive public relation campaigns, or more recently (and
more effectively) by controlling the algorithms of social media
platforms to propagate the worldviews that suit their interests at a
given time.</p>

<p>One of the primary fronts of war in an irregular conflict is the mind.
Unconventional war is often won by the attrition of the enemy’s will to
fight and the collapse of their culture. Unrestricted conflict is
characterized by hazy lines between civilian and combatant and a turn
towards population-centric warfare (see box z) which may involve
everything from getting a population to oppose a war to sowing bitter
infighting and turning a population against itself.</p>
<p>Population-centric warfare targets the social and cultural underpinnings
of a civilization just as the destruction of roads, crops, and military
assets targets physical infrastructures.</p>

<p>Today every major government and non-state actor is engaging in what has
been called *computational propaganda — *the use of information
technologies to augment population-centric warfare. Cyborg armies are
assembled, a mixture of human brains, cultural software (memes), digital
hardware, and artificial intelligence. They are then deployed in the
digital sphere with</p>
<p>citizens on social media being subject to propaganda from all sides:
domestic political parties, foreign governments, corporations, and a
variety of non-state actors, all aided by AI bots and sock puppet
accounts^123^. <em><strong>While</strong> <strong>increasingly</strong> <strong>powerful</strong> <strong>weapons</strong>
<strong>are</strong> <strong>being</strong> <strong>distributed</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>the broader public, state and
non-state actors are escalating and technologically enhancing their
population-centric warfare efforts, often with the explicit intent to
polarize, confuse and radicalize the enemy</strong>’<strong>s population</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In some cases those on the receiving end of a propaganda campaign are
military veterans who themselves have been through tactical training. In
2020 professional troll farms in Eastern Europe were creating the
content for the 16 most popular Christian facebook pages, influencing
millions of users from a demographic known to include retired US
military and law enforcement.^124^ Within the last decade there have
been domestic terrorism attacks on critical US infrastructure that
likely could not have been done without military training. The attack on
the Metcalf transmission station in 2013, for example, was called a
“professional job” and “the most significant incident of domestic
terrorism involving the grid that has ever occurred.” Before opening
fire on the transformers, the attackers cut the fiber optic lines that
were running nearby. They knew precisely where to shoot the
transformers, aiming at the oil-cooling systems, causing them to leak
and overheat. The perpetrators and their motives remain unclear to this
day. The point here is not that the Metcalf attack was necessarily the
result of information warfare or social media radicalization. The
concern is that the risk of similar events has increased, given the
thousands of former special operations officers, trained to identify
high leverage strategic targets, who are now increasingly subject to
radicalizing content online and have grown distrustful of their
government and fellow citizens.</p>
<p>In response to this threat — of population-centric warfare radicalizing
military or political officials — the Chinese Communist Party now
requires military officers to use approved phones, which are heavily
regulated and do not have access to certain features. No comparable
policies have been rolled out in Western nations like the United States.
Such strong government intervention is often viewed as heavy-handed and
invasive, undermining personal freedoms. However, they</p>
<p>^123^ While impossible to determine the exact number of AI bots on the
internet, one estimate suggests that 73% of all internet traffic during

<p>also defend against a critical attack surface and increase the
competitive advantage of the CCP in terms of the psychological security
of its citizens, military, and political officials. This tension between
security and liberty is at the heart of the metacrisis; where humanity
finds itself caught in several double binds.</p>
<p>Today the human psyche is the most undefended terrain in modern warfare.
In most domains of war, advances in offensive capability are matched
with corresponding advances in defense.</p>
<p>New missiles are met with new missile detection and defense systems.
When cyberattacks improve so does cybersecurity. But this has mostly not
held true in population-centric warfare. Psychological-attacks have
become vastly more powerful than psychological-defense. In part this is
because competing to manipulate the hearts and minds of people is
different than seeking to protect and educate them. Countering an
enemy’s propaganda campaign with a propaganda campaign of your own is
not providing psychological defense. It is a recipe for destroying a
population’s ability to make sense of the world around them, thereby
ushering in an age of collective insanity.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies like generative AI are radically escalating this
mismatch between psychological attack and defense. The hidden power of
AI generated content is undue influence that is impossible to resist or
detect, for which there is currently no known means of
psychological-security. Hyper-realistic images leave lasting
impressions. Even if we later learn that an image was false, the effects
do not go away. The image cannot be unseen, and the association cannot
be erased. The intentional use of these tactics in conflict to shape a
target’s perception and action is what we call Pavlovian Warfare (in
reference to the Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov whose experiments laid
the foundations for behaviorist psychology). The logical conclusion of
increasing Pavlovian Warfare is that the rate, volume, and
personalization of AI generated content so systematically desensitizes
the population to differences in what is real and fake that humanity
enters into a world where such distinctions are effectively lost, a

<p>In the wake of Hiroshima and Nagaski, it was evident to many that the
all-out use of our most powerful weapons would be suicide, and total
nuclear war would not be of benefit to anyone moving forward.
Fortunately, for a short time, bipolar conflict between the US and USSR
simplified nuclear deterrence. At first only these two nations had major
nuclear programs with strategic arsenals which resulted in a massive and
visible physical footprint. It was demonstrable that both sides could
maintain enough weapons to retaliate against an enemy attack, ensuring
that neither the US nor USSR would have a totalizing first-strike
advantage. No one initiated a direct kinetic conflict due to the
likelihood of it escalating to nuclear conflict and thus their own
annihilation as a result. This was the doctrine of *Mutually Assured
Destruction *(MAD), the public policy of the US and USSR to deter the
use of nuclear weapons during the Cold War.</p>
<p><em><strong>There is no analogous strategy to mutually assured destruction for
this new class of widely</strong> <strong>distributed,</strong> <strong>massively</strong> <strong>powerful,</strong>
<strong>advanced</strong> <strong>technologies</strong></em>. Strategic responses to non-state actors
significantly diverge from those assumed in traditional military
strategy.</p>
<p>Members of a terrorist network, for example, may embrace the possibility
of an honorable death and are not necessarily deterred by threats of
retaliation. In contexts of asymmetric warfare, retaliation by the
larger actor may actually make the smaller player stronger. It is
extremely difficult to target an enemy with no head that is
spontaneously emerging and self-organizing out of the population. When
the target is a decentralized network loosely organized around a
particular worldview, failure to eliminate the entire support base can
lead to something like antibiotic resistance. If the whole network is
not destroyed, it may simply reproduce and adapt.</p>
<p>Unlike elected officials, and autocratic leaders, the potential for
political and military blowback does not cause these actors to
automatically hesitate to use their most powerful weapons. The idea of
mutually assured destruction was only reasonable because the leaders of
each nation could somewhat safely assume that the other was interested
in their own survival; i.e., that mutual destruction was viewed as a bad
outcome by both parties. Today, individuals and groups with worldviews
from the seventh century are being given 21st century technology whose
destructive capabilities did not even exist a decade ago and any
comparable capacities were only given to the highest ranking political
and military officials whose motivations, training, and responsibilities
were somewhat more predictable and well-understood.</p>
<p>Today’s civilization is distributing increasingly dangerous capabilities
to many different types of actors with wildly divergent worldviews, in a
world where people feel more disenfranchised, desperate and sympathetic
to extreme ideologies. Classical deterrence is no longer possible.
Predicting where an attack will come from and how a conflict will
escalate is no longer possible. As more and more groups are pulled into
irregular warfare with increasing access to technological capabilities,
the line between combatants and civilians has blurred. Under such
conditions, civilization either breaks down from increasing catastrophic
violence, or becomes a human rights disaster due to the implementation
of an advanced tech mediated police state.</p>
<p>This tension then creates a positive feedback loop as the fear of the
draconian system of control is also a major motivator of radicalization,
increasing extremism and increasing surveillance are coupled, both
justify themselves in terms of the other.</p>
<p><strong>[The Risk of Nuclear ]{.underline}[War]{.underline}</strong></p>
<p>Even with the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, humanity was
frighteningly close to total nuclear war on several occasions, such as
the Cuban Missile Crisis, in which we only narrowly avoided complete
annihilation based on a decision made by a single USSR submarine
commander^125^. The head of the United States’ Strategic Command,
General George Butler, once said that “We escaped the Cold War without a
nuclear holocaust by some combination of skill, luck, and divine
intervention, and I suspect the latter in greatest proportion.”^126^
Upon an examination of history, we find that those most closely involved
with the situation saw humanity’s survival as somewhat of a miracle (and
this was in a world with only two nuclear superpowers). We also find
that nuclear policy was much like other public policies: highly
contested and subject to vociferous debate and disagreement. Mutually
Assured Destruction was the <em>publicly stated doctrine</em>. Not everyone in
the military establishment agreed with it.</p>
<p>Several prominent strategists believed nuclear war could escalate
gradually just like other</p>
<p>^125^ Vasili Arkhipov convinced his commander that their submarine was
not under attack, preventing the launch of a nuclear missile. National
Security Archive. (2022). <em>The Underwater Cuban Missile Crisis at 60</em>.
National Security Archive.</p>
<p>^126^ Schlosser, E. (2014). *Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the
Damascus Accident, and the illusion of safety. *Penguin Books.</p>
<p>conflicts; all-out nuclear war was only one of several possibilities.
Others argued that first-strike advantage was achievable and should be
pursued at all costs^127^.</p>
<p>While the US and USSR were publicly preaching deterrence and
disarmament, they were also racing to achieve nuclear superiority.
Trillions of dollars later,^128^ humanity is responsible for an arsenal
of unimaginably nightmarish weaponry, including nuclear “bunker
busters,” delivery systems with satellite precision, and hypersonic
missiles. Recent classes of hypersonic missiles can travel between
7-19,000 miles per hour ^129^. With satellite and laser precision, they
can hit targets within meters of their intended location^130^. Modern
nuclear missiles may be launched from the air, underwater, or land (the
<em>Nuclear Triad</em>) from thousands of points distributed around the globe.
The submarines and aircrafts wielding them are rapidly improving in
speed and stealth capability and may be operated directly by a human,
controlled remotely, or (in principle) completely autonomously guided by
AI. The need to monitor possible nuclear strikes demands a panopticonic
system of global surveillance maintained by every major power.</p>

<p>The original logic of mutually assured destruction — believed by some
portion of the security community — was only formally possible with two
nuclear superpowers. Every added nuclear power (and advancements in
weapons of mass destruction) brought an element of uncertainty and a
change in nuclear doctrine. Today nine nations possess warheads, at
least four of whom are holding the coveted nuclear triad. There are now
many actors with many different methods of escalation and a vastly more
complex environment of geopolitical alliances and tensions, making it
essentially impossible for deterrence policy to be as stable as it was
during the Cold</p>
<p>^127^ The Sigal 1979 paper goes into it a lot more. Wohlstetter is the
other main strategist that advocated first use. Prior to the USSR
getting weapons John von Neumman notoriously said “you say tomorrow, I
say today”</p>

<p>The situation between the US and China, for example, is a fundamentally
different kind of geopolitical conflict than that of the US and USSR in
the Cold War. Unlike the USA and USSR, the US and Chinese economies are
deeply entangled and mutually dependent^131^. In the midst of this
dependence, systemic rivalry between the two nations is ongoing and
escalating including economic tactics like export controls to prevent
technological advancement, dominance over critical resources (such as
rare earth metals, oil, etc.) militarily and economically backing the
others’ adversary (e.g., China’s support for Russia; the US for Taiwan),
espionage, intellectual property theft, continuous cyberwarfare, and
deliberate political interference and cultural influence campaigns.
Complex and consequential alliances have been formed by the two nations,
and their conflict takes place alongside escalating tensions between
several other nuclear armed nations: for example, between China, India,
and Pakistan, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, and the
increasingly dangerous and destructive war between Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>When the US and USSR were the only nations with strategic nuclear
arsenals, the situation was horrifically precarious and came quite close
to world ending war. Today ***there are more paths to nuclear conflict
and profound uncertainty in nuclear policy, making the prevention of
nuclear weapon use radically more difficult than in the past.
***Advancing technologies, changes in military and political leadership,
and shifting systems of geopolitical alliances have made nuclear
doctrine much more ambiguous. It is an open question, for example,
whether or not the use of tactical nuclear weapons (smaller, short-range
weapons used on the battlefield to destroy specific targets) would
result in full blown nuclear war^132^. More people in positions of</p>
<p>^131^ Elon Musk referred to them as effectively “conjoined twins.”
Shepherd, C., Tobin, M. (2023). *China gives Elon Musk a hero’s
welcome - and a message for the U.S. *Washington Post.</p>
<p>^132^ The Bush administration considered using nuclear weapons against
Iraq as ‘bunker busters.’ Arkin, W.</p>
<p>M. (2003). *The Nuclear Option in Iraq. *Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>A Pentagon policy review identified Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as
potential targets for American nuclear strikes. Schmitt, E. (2002).
*U.S. Tries To Explain New Policy For A-Bomb. *New York Times.</p>
<p>the Us Strategic Command (STRATCOM) described nuclear weapons as the
most valuable in the arsenal because “unlike chemical or biological
weapons, the extreme destruction from a nuclear explosion is immediate,
with few if any palliatives to reduce its effect.” <strong>*</strong>(WMDS)</p>
<p>STRATCOM has written that “…it hurts to portray ourselves as too
fully rational and cool-headed. The fact that some elements may appear
to be potentially “out of control” can be beneficial to creating and
reinforcing fears and doubts within the minds of an adversary’s
decision-makers.” STRATCOM. (1995).</p>
<p>military influence are advocating for the value of deploying
smaller-scale warheads in battle, arguing that it is possible to do so
without leading to total annihilation. This shift in tide can be seen in
the increasing number of tactical nuclear systems being developed today
and in the ballooning R&amp;D budgets directed towards modernizing today’s
arsenals. Willingness to “think the unthinkable” is growing.</p>
<p>Cyber-warfare is also deeply complicating the situation. It is possible
to hack nuclear systems to stop operations, initiate false launches,
cause a missile detection system to signal an attack which is not
actually occurring, or to hide one which is imminently incoming.
Dependence on digital systems vulnerable to cyberattack makes
attribution for a nuclear strike more difficult and subject to plausible
deniability. No nation can be confident that their critical information
technology will work under sophisticated cyber warfare. Evidence
suggests that the nuclear programs and systems of at least two major
nations have already been successfully penetrated by
cyberoperations^133^. The doctrines of several states now include the
possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>In war (conventional or irregular), uncertainty tends to make everyone
more aggressive. “Best practice” is to assume the worst possible
intentions of one’s adversary until proven otherwise. Military strategy,
budgets, and weapons development are guided by this principle. This
reliably drives arms races, as each innovation in weaponry and strategy
is matched and ratcheted up by corresponding developments on all sides
— rapidly increasing the upper bound of total possible violence as a
result. All nuclear-armed states continue to modernize their forces at a
significant pace. While the number of nuclear weapons in the world has
declined since the Cold War, the pace of reduction has slowed and mostly
continues in order to dismantle retired weapons. The general trend is
that total nuclear capability is increasing, and the technologies are
becoming vastly more sophisticated. Nuclear powers still have strong
reason not to initiate a full-scale strike against the other, but the
countless close calls during the Cold War remind us that, even in a
radically simpler situation, increased suspicions, arms build-up, and
military maneuvering are sufficient to bring us to the brink of total
war.</p>

<p>Breakdown of Security Apparatus: Overwhelm or Oppression</p>
<p>[EDITS]</p>
<p>There are massive security systems whose purpose is to prevent
catastrophes from violence, but they are reaching the limits of their
ability to do so. This is due in part to the overwhelming complexity of
managing the situation, which can be seen through the lens of a few
pernicious asymmetries. Offensive technologies are exceeding defensive
ones (it is easier, and cheaper, to create a killer drone swarm than to
defend against it)^134^. Decentralized catastrophe weapons are being
developed and disseminated faster than effective regulation can be
created to contain them. Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), information
overwhelm, and bitter political infighting are intensifying; clear,
coherent dialogue and democratic action are not. Enmity and coercive
geopolitical maneuvering is vastly more common than acts of earnest
diplomacy, and it is much harder to rebuild trust once it has been lost.</p>
<p>Stress on the system is compounding. In addition to the asymmetries
mentioned above, there is an abundance of ecological and economic
factors that are increasing the potential for catastrophic violence.
More severe and frequent extreme weather events and unprecedented rates
of displaced peoples are not conditions conducive for peace. Neither is
a civilization which is surpassing planetary boundaries and hitting
limits to economic growth. Desperate and disgruntled populations
witnessing incredible economic inequality, who have also been the
targets of population-centric warfare for decades, are much more willing
to be violent. When engaging with the system peacefully has failed to
provide safety and security for oneself or one’s people, it is a natural
conclusion made by many that maybe engaging violently will offer better
results.</p>
<p>The externalities of a world system under continuous irregular warfare
are accelerating. Geopolitical tensions are intensifying as everyone is
hoping to be the winner on the other side of the new technological
paradigm. The class of advanced technologies is much more difficult to
contain, monitor, and control than nuclear, and there are no existing
deterrence and security strategies besides totalizing surveillance. The
costs and complexity of security are rapidly increasing as the number of
threats grow and new combatants arrive on the scene. Even if</p>
<p>^134^ Thompson, L. (2022). *Defeating Drones: The Most Promising Weapons
Are All Non-Kinetic. *Forbes.</p>
<p>these factors were overcome, the resulting defense system — one of
unprecedented scope and power — would be at grave risk of abuse. This
is the topic of the next chapter: the growing possibility of dystopian
oppression emerging from an unprecedented surveillance and police state.</p>
<p>This pendulum swing between two nightmare futures (chaos and oppression)
is a product of unique features of advanced technology. While nuclear
weapons could be used to threaten catastrophic war and destruction, they
could not be repurposed to spy on a population or subtly shape their
mind with deep-fakes and AI generated content. Advanced technologies
like AI, robotics, drones, biotech, and IoT can be destructive (like
nukes), but their ability to be repurposed for virtually any goal
enables both catastrophic and dystopic potential like nothing else in
history.</p>
<p>Atomic technology was also intrinsically power centralizing, where this
new paradigm drives both the centralization and decentralization of
power in parallel. Our current world system — its economic, legal, and
security apparatuses — depends upon a certain ratio of power
consolidation and distribution. It was built to have the centralized
power necessary for a monopoly of violence to enforce law, while
distributing enough power to overthrow the system if it became too
corrupt. Advanced technology threatens to break that in both directions:
leading to potentially uncheckable consolidations of power, or forms of
power decentralization that fundamentally undermine rule of law, placing
us in a state of anarchy.</p>
<p><del>…</del></p>
<p>a Nukes can threaten war, but they cannot actually spy on you and
influence your mind the way that deep fakes or social media can. The
ability to make shit and break shit, to influence everything with the
same tech, gives not just the catastrophe but the dystopia potential
more. So new technology makes many more pathways to catastrophe, and is
directly applicable to control dystopias.</p>
