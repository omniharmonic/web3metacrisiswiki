<p>[Ch 3: Ecological Overshoot]{.underline}</p>
<p>The emergence of large scale civilizations depended upon a unique state
of the biosphere. The favorable climate, the life supporting
environment, and the relative abundance of resources were needed for the
permanent settlement and agriculture required for a growing population.</p>
<p>These essential conditions, necessary for humans and countless other
species, are now being undermined. The cumulative effects of an
exponentially growing global economy powered by industrial technology
operating at a planetary-scale have critically degenerated the biosphere
which has sustained all of life up to this point.</p>
<p>The current world system’s rates of resource depletion, pollution, and
waste accumulation are occurring much faster than the ecology can
tolerate in order to remain stable. This relationship between the two
systems of the biosphere and global civilization is coming to an end as
it will no longer be able to support billions of people, and if
continued, will result in a radically less habitable planet. For there
to be a desirable future for humanity, civilization will need to become
ecologically regenerative and long-term compatible with the
biosphere^1^.</p>
<p>^1^ See, for example, Richardson, Katherine, Steffen, Will, and Lucht,
Wolfgang et al. “Earth beyond six of nine planetary boundaries.”
*Science Advances <em>9</em>, *aadh2458 (2023). doi:</p>
<p>Some examples of environmental crises that reflect the current trend of
ecological overshoot include: biodiversity loss^2^, loss of keystone
species and extinction cascades^3^, overfishing^4^,</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there are environmentalists who will not support
the idea of ecological overshoot due to the belief that technological
advancements reduce humanity’s dependence on nature (e.g. industrial
agriculture). Therefore any physical boundaries to human consumption are
“so theoretical as to be functionally irrelevant”. Technological
advancements such as nuclear fusion and genetically engineered crops
will guarantee the survival of civilization and promise to decouple
economic growth from environmental impacts.</p>
<p>It will become clear throughout this chapter and the following why we
are less optimistic about technology’s ability to save us from
ecological overshoot. Decades of environmental research continues to
support the notion of ecological overshoot and limits to growth, with
little evidence to support any progress on “absolute decoupling” —
i.e., that technological advancement and economic growth can occur
independently of ecological extraction.</p>

<p>^3^ Extinction cascades are the domino effect of coextinctions, where
the loss of one species leads to the demise of others connected in a
food web. This tends to magnify the rate of biodiversity loss and
extinction risk. One modeling study found that in average climate
scenarios, coextinctions will increase the biodiversity impact of
primary extinctions by 184%, leading to an average of nearly 18% of loss
in local vertebrate biodiversity by the end of this century. Such
cascades are even more pronounced in cases where top predators and
keystone species are lost, which can lead to the unraveling of entire
food webs.</p>

<p>^9^ There is some disagreement on definitions for ecosystem collapse.
One working definition being used here is : “A degraded ecosystem state
that results from the abrupt decline and loss of biodiversity, ecosystem
functions and/or services, where these losses are both substantial and
persistent, such that they cannot fully recover unaided within decadal
timescales.” Examples include eutrophication of freshwater lakes,
fragmentation of food webs in grasslands, and overfishing leading to
trophic collapse in coral reefs. This definition is from Newton, Adrian,
C., Britton, Bob, and Davies, Kimberly, L. et al. “Operationalising the
concept of ecosystem collapse for conservation practice.” *Biological

<p>Ecological overshoot is already an existential threat to the countless
complex life forms facing extinction. 70% of the individuals of all
vertebrate species have disappeared since 1970^15^.</p>
<p>Human activity has increased the current rate of species extinction at
least 100 times greater than the average rate over the past 65 million
years. We are perpetuating a mass extinction event — the sixth in
Earth’s 4.5 billion year history — destroying the web of life upon
which we fundamentally depend^16^.</p>
<p>The mass destruction of sentient life and billions of years of
biological evolution is unethical and unacceptable on its own terms. It
is like an <em><strong>ecological genocide</strong></em>^17^, where the violence is not</p>

<p>^16^ Background extinction rates are measured in extinctions per
million-species years (E/MSY). Ceballos et al. (2015) considered a
(conservative) background extinction rate based on empirical fossil
records of 2 E/MSY, equivalent to 2 extinctions for every 10,000
vertebrate species per 100 years. Current extinction rates are

<p>Humanity is now approaching, and in some cases already surpassing,
several planetary boundaries^18^. These are the “safe operating limits”
of the Earth system which, once crossed, may have devastating and
potentially irreversible consequences. Moving beyond certain boundaries
risks triggering ecological tipping points: self-reinforcing feedback
loops where critical Earth systems are suddenly brought from a prior
safe state to a potentially catastrophic one*^19^*.</p>
<p>^18^ The Planetary Boundaries framework was developed by an
international group of environmental scientists at the Stockholm
Resilience Centre in 2009, and quantifies nine interrelated boundary
processes within the biophysical Earth System which have been heavily
perturbed by human activity. These include Climate change, Novel
Entities, Biosphere Integrity, Land System Change, Freshwater Change,
Biogeochemical Flows, Ocean Acidification, Atmospheric Aerosol Loading,
Stratospheric Ozone Depletion.</p>
<p>Staying within Planetary Boundaries allows the Earth to remain in a
habitable, “Holocene-like” state similar to the last 10,000 years in
which agriculture and modern civilization arose. Crossing boundaries
increases the risk of large-scale, abrupt or irreversible disruption to
the Earth System - endangering stability and life support systems
critical for human welfare. As of 2023, the first full quantification of
these boundaries revealed six out of nine boundaries have been
transgressed.</p>

beyond six of nine planetary boundaries.” *Sci. Adv. *9,
(2023):eadh2458. doi:</p>

operating space for humanity.” <em>Nature</em></p>
<p>461, (2009):472—475.</p>
<p>^19^ In the Earth Systems literature, there are subtle distinctions
between the concept of a “planetary boundary” and that of a “tipping
point.” Planetary boundaries were defined for the purposes of assessing
safe levels of human impact on the earth and to avoid the worst
long-term impacts. They neither rule out nor assume the existence of
tipping points. They are points of acceptable risk to stay within a
“safe operating zone” for processes at the scale of the whole Earth
system.</p>
<p>Tipping points, on the other hand, are nonlinear thresholds between a
driver and the state of a system (e.g. nutrients added to a freshwater
lake until it switches to having no oxygen and mostly algae). They occur
when a change in a dynamical system becomes self-perpetuating beyond a
certain threshold as a result of asymmetries between balancing and
destabilizing feedback loops. Tipping points are ubiquitous</p>
<p>One example of an ecological tipping point is the disruption of the
Amazon rainforest’s <em>hydrological cycle</em>. A common cause of
deforestation is clear cutting or burning rainforest, often to create
space for animal agriculture or crop production (such as cattle, soy and
palm oil).</p>
<p>Alongside a hotter and drier climate, this has significant effects on
the region’s hydrological cycle in which water moves from the land to
the atmosphere by evaporation from soil and transpiration from plants
and then back to land by means of rainfall. Deforestation leads to less
rainfall because the atmosphere is no longer “taking up” water
transpired from the trees. Water was also being held in the root systems
and bodies of the trees, so less water from rainfall can be “taken in”
and stored by the forest ecosystem. In turn, these drier conditions make
it easier to burn larger amounts of the forest, and also increase the
occurrence and severity of forest fires^20^.</p>
<p>Leading Earth system scientists argue that, beyond a critical point, a
runaway feedback loop is triggered: drier conditions from burning,
deforestation, and climate change lead to more severe burning and
greater tree loss in an accelerating fashion, ultimately resulting in a
rainforest</p>
<p>across systems of all scales, from lakes and forests to ice sheets and
ecosystems.</p>
<p>Crossing a planetary boundary entails higher risks of passing tipping
points for related subsystems, for example, the collapse of ocean
currents, ice sheets and coral reefs for climate change; or trophic
cascades and ecosystem collapse for biodiversity integrity. Planetary
boundaries themselves are not necessarily “global tipping points.” Most
known tipping points are at local, regional or continental scales -
though tipping points themselves can have planetary-scale ramifications.</p>

<p>^20^ The Global Tipping Points report describes two amplifying feedback
mechanisms for tropical forest tipping behavior. At regional scales, the
dominant mechanism stabilizing tropical forests like the Amazon is the
forest-rainfall feedback, where the forest increases annual rainfall by
recycling water through evapotranspiration, and reducing
seasonal-interannual variability. Deforestation causes this feedback to
become destabilizing, inducing further tree mortality. At local scales,
fire-vegetation feedback can maintain an ecosystem in an open vegetation
state; less tree cover lets fire spread more easily across drier, more
flammable grasses, which prevents trees from growing back.</p>
<p>Moreover, the forest-rainfall and fire-vegetation feedbacks amplify each
other. Both of these make it possible for the Amazon rainforest to tip
into a degraded forest or open savannah as a result of climate change
and deforestation.</p>

<p>ecosystem no longer able to sustain itself.^21^ The Amazon is the
largest contiguous forest in the world, therefore a disruption of its
hydrological cycle would have significant effects on global rainfall
patterns. For example, winds move the water transpired from trees in the
Amazon to other regions of the world, contributing to rainfall in areas
such as South America. One of the consequences of passing this tipping
point---“breaking” the hydrological cycle of the Amazon--- would be a
catastrophic disruption of rainfall in South America, likely leading to
food and water insecurity and associated public health, national
security, and economic crises^22^.</p>

circulation over the continent. One estimate suggests that Amazon
dieback would lead to economic damages of up to $US 3,589 billion, an
order of magnitude greater than the GDP of the Amazon area.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to predict exactly when tipping points will be
crossed^23^. However, even given conservative estimates placing certain
tipping points decades (rather than mere years) away, without
significant structural changes, their likelihood increases to near
certainty over time^24^.</p>
<p>There are several critical planetary boundaries that are suspected to
have already been crossed. For example, toxic “forever chemicals,” such
as those used in plastic products, non-stick cookware, water-repellent
materials, and stain-resistant fabrics (PFAS)^25^, were</p>

<p>^25^ As mentioned in footnote 19 above, the planetary boundary for novel
entities (such as PFAS) is not technically a tipping point. Surpassing
it does not imply an abrupt shift in the dynamics of an ecological or
Earth system. However, Persson et al. (2022) concluded we are outside
the safe operating zone for novel entities because annual production of
these outstrips the pace of global capacity for assessment and
monitoring. Establishing a physically quantitative boundary for all
novel entities, however, is an intractable problem, as there are over
350,000 novel chemicals and mixtures, of which one third are
confidential or ambiguously described.</p>

increased 50-fold since 1950. Out of the 350,000 chemicals registered
globally, 70,000 have been registered in the past decade, with nearly
half of these in emerging economies where management and disposal
capacity is limited. Many synthetic chemicals, pesticides,
pharmaceuticals are persistent or “pseudo-persistent” taking a long time
to degrade, or having environmental release that exceeds degradation
rates. With an increasing rate of production of existing and new
persistent chemicals, a substantial fraction of which do not degrade in
the environment, the rate of accumulation in the environment is
plausibly exponential.</p>

<p>chemicals are distributed everywhere (often invisible): sitting on the
surface of water, evaporating into the atmosphere, and raining down upon
all of humanity and the biosphere as a whole. Occasionally some of these
chemicals are banned, but too often, they are simply replaced with
others which are potentially equally as harmful and whose long-term
safety is largely unknown^33^.</p>
<p>In the United States in 2019 there were approximately 3.4 billion pounds
of toxic chemicals released into the environment^34^. The link between
synthetic chemical exposure and cancer is fairly well-established:
environmental toxins may be responsible for between 1% and 19% of human
cancers, and 5% of childhood cancers^35^. <em><strong>Our assault on the

<p>The consequences of passing critical ecological limits may exhibit
<em>delayed causation</em>. This means there can be catastrophic risks from
certain environmental harms that effectively become inevitable even if
the situation appears safe and stable at the moment the boundary is
crossed. Coordinated effort will be required to mitigate such damages
from those limits which we have already exceeded and to avoid those
which humanity is rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the various identifiable planetary boundaries — such as
those involved in deforestation, chemical pollution, or climate change
— must be thought of as more than isolated environmental problems to be
solved. Rather, they each reflect a general increase in cumulative
stress to the biosphere from increasing depletion and toxicity. The
various subsystems within the biosphere are deeply interconnected, and
environmental harms interact, accumulate, and compound.^43^</p>

environmental crises. Burning and deforestation emits massive amounts of

change while simultaneously destroying the trees best equipped to

<p><em>Human activity pushes multiple planetary boundaries in parallel</em>, and
there may be many environmental risks that are unexpected and difficult
to identify in advance. It only takes crossing one critical planetary
boundary to threaten substantial and irreversible impacts to the
biosphere. Even if greenhouse gas emissions were somehow reversed, for
example, passing safe limits on biodiversity or chemical pollution could
still massively damage humanity’s prospects. Therefore, it is the
broader threat of ecological overshoot — and the structures of
civilization which give rise to it — which must become the object of
shared focus and international collaboration.</p>
<p><em>[Misalignment]{.underline}[ ]{.underline}[in]{.underline}[
]{.underline}[the]{.underline}[
]{.underline}[Biosphere-Civilization]{.underline}[
]{.underline}[Relationship]{.underline}</em></p>
<p>*<strong>Navigating the metacrisis requires an epochal shift in the
biosphere-civilization relationship</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>which</strong> <strong>underlying</strong>
<strong>causes</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>ecological</strong> <strong>overshoot</strong> <strong>must</strong> <strong>be</strong>
<strong>addressed.</strong> **This entails resolving fundamental structural
misalignments between the two planetary-scale processes of economic
production and consumption on the one hand and ecological regeneration
and renewal on the other. ***The emergence of a truly sustainable
civilization depends on, among other things, a deep redesign of global
supply chains, the world’s financial system, and associated planetary
governance.</p>
<p>Intrinsic to historical industrial supply chains are the processes of
resource acquisition, manufacturing, and distribution. This includes the
energy required throughout the process and the pollution and waste
generated as a byproduct. In economics this is referred to as a <em>linear
materials economy</em>: the economic process beginning at the point of
resource extraction and ending at the point of waste disposal. In
natural systems, there are analogous processes occurring between other
species, such as herbivores consuming plants, carnivores consuming other
species, plants consuming resources from the soil, and so on. However,
these ecological processes are not linear. They are circular: the waste
of one organism becomes the resource of another in turn.</p>
<p>For the majority of history, human extraction and waste were also able
to be metabolized by the environment just like those of any other
organism. However, this phase gradually ended as industrial scale human
activity could extract more resources and produce more toxic chemicals</p>
<p>and waste than the biosphere evolved to process^61^. No other species,
or even era of our species, can synthesize millions of new chemicals per
year that are unfamiliar to the biosphere and take multiple thousands of
years to break down, or clear cut a football field of forest every few
seconds^62^ and create floating patches of garbage three times the size
of France.</p>
<p>Humans ability to degrade the oceans is particularly striking. The
surface of the Earth is largely composed of water (covering a little
less than ¾ of the planet). Half of the Earth’s photosynthesis occurs
in the ocean, and produces as much as 70% of the oxygen in the
atmosphere. It is even possible that complex life evolved out of the
ocean^63^. However, since the industrial revolution, humans have put
enough waste into the ocean that microplastics and pharmaceutical
remnants can be found in every cubic inch of the ocean. There are now
multiple heaps of trash floating in the ocean, the smallest of which is
roughly twice the size of Germany^64^. As a result of agricultural
runoff there are over 400 *dead zones *in the ocean where most forms of
ocean life can no longer exist^65^. Human activity has also warmed,
acidified, and</p>

<p>^62^ Global Deforestation rates from Global Forest Watch is 22.7 Mha in
2022. This is equivalent to 7206m^2^ of forest loss per second. The
standard size of a football pitch is 105x68m = 7140m^2^, hence roughly a
football pitch every second.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the total annual forest loss from Global Forest
Watch is broken down by driver of loss, and not all of this is clear
cutting (e.g. forestry). If we just include **permanent **forest loss
according to their breakdown, this becomes 4.77 Mha for commodity driven
deforestation + 136 Kha urbanization, which is about1557 m^2^ per
second. This turns the above estimate closer to a soccer/football field
of permanent deforestation every 4.5 seconds.</p>

Based on direct aerial surveys, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was
found to be 1.6 million km^2^, between 4 - 16 times higher than previous
estimates and almost 3x the size of France (549,000 km^2^). The other
four garbage patches are in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian
Ocean and South Pacific, with size estimates ranging from 0.7 million

double this area) to upwards of 5 million km^2^.</p>

Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic.” <em>Scientific

a misnomer. These are oxygen minimum zones which are hypoxic (less than
2 ml O<del>2</del> per litre), and can lead to mass mortality of aquatic life,
but algae proliferates. In about half of oceanic dead zones,
eutrophication (accumulation of nutrients) kicks off rapid microbial
growth which uses up oxygen, killing off other life and maintaining high
nutrient but low oxygen levels. In its worst</p>
<p>polluted the entire ocean to the point where countless species
(including coral reefs) are threatened or dying off at massive scales.</p>
<p>Throughout biological evolution the relative power of each organism was
small when compared to the environment as a whole. The lion may be an
apex predator, but it could do nothing to destroy the broader ecosystem,
let alone the entire biosphere. This is not true of a technologically
advanced civilization capable of geoengineering at planetary scale.</p>
<p><strong>[Externalities and Embedded Growth
]{.underline}[Obligations]{.underline}</strong></p>
<p>Other life forms also don’t rely on financial systems that externalize
costs to the commons or require exponential growth of goods and services
to function^66^. The phrase “negative externality” in economics is used
to describe a cost that is not reflected in the balance sheet of a
company. For example, in 2024, it was estimated that, at the current
rate it is being produced, the cost of removing and destroying PFAS from
the environment would likely exceed the GDP of the entire world at 106
trillion USD^67^. This means that the profitability of companies
producing and using</p>
<p>form, oxygen falls further to anoxia (near zero O<del>2</del>) and microbes begin
generating poisonous hydrogen sulfide.</p>
<p>Recent studies have found a large increase in open ocean oxygen minimum
zones. Altieri et al. (2017) notes at least 497 dead zones are currently
listed, with at least 370 more yet to be described, about half of which
impact tropical reefs. Stramma et al. (2010) found open ocean oxygen
minimum zones increased by 4.5 million km^2^ (about the size of the
European Union) over 50 years from 1960—1974 to 1990—2008. The volume
of water that has gone completely anoxic has quadrupled in that same
time period.</p>

environment at current emission rates.” <em>The Science of the total

<p>PFAS depends upon them not paying the costs for its remediation (or the
healthcare costs of those who are getting cancer from it). Those costs
are “external” to the “internal” accounting of the company. Until the
industries are forced to pay those costs, the burden of the
externalities is being borne by the public. This is true for many
industries, whose profitability is predicated upon externalized harm to
the biosphere or to the social-sphere. Those who benefit do not pay the
true costs, which fall outside of their accounting systems.</p>
<p>In addition to externalized costs, obligations for economic growth are
embedded in the most basic structures underpinning the global financial
system, such as debt and interest. Banks, for example, must offer
consistent annual returns to clients with ongoing accounts. Corporations
or nation-states receiving loans, as is commonplace in venture capital
and international development, must return the original cost of the loan
plus accrued interest. Financial systems employing interest require the
total amount of currency in circulation to increase every year (equal to
the sum of the monetary supply from the previous year plus the
interest)^68^. When this is applied to the original cost plus accrued
interest, it creates a compounding, exponential curve, driving
exponential growth in the monetary supply. This is an engine of economic
growth.</p>
<p>Influxes of debt and the creation of currency create risks such as
insolvency (the inability to pay back debts) and inflation (the
debasement of currency value). To avoid financial system failure, there
must be a continuous — and exponential — increase in economic returns
with corresponding increases in the availability of goods and services.
For any system subject to debt and interest, growth is required for
survival. The economy is not simply growing because there is increasing
demand on the part of consumers. Rather, it is growing, in large part,
because the increases in debt and currency must be met with economic
growth to prevent financial system collapse.</p>

<p>Increases in economic activity ultimately ground out in increasing
resource extraction, energy use, and commercial manufacturing. It has
been shown that economic growth — for example, as measured by global
gross domestic product (GDP) — is around 99% correlated with growth in
the use of energy (e.g., fossil fuels). To create 5 trillion USD of
additional wealth (globally) requires the equivalent of 174 million
barrels of oil.^69^ Increasing wealth is also tightly coupled with
increasing use of raw materials such as sand, minerals, and lumber —
with roughly every dollar of GDP corresponding to 1.2 kilograms of raw
materials^70^. More production, more purchases, and more profits all
depend on powering buildings and transporting products.</p>
<p>Economic growth is therefore inextricably linked to increasing resource
depletion, pollution, waste, and toxicity^71^. (In part two of this
book, we explore why engineering solutions that increase the efficiency
of renewable energy sources will not necessarily resolve this dilemma
due to a well-established — yet paradoxical — trend where increases in
energy efficiency actually lead to us using more energy rather than
less^72^).</p>
<p>^69^ Garrett (2011) found based on thermodynamic principles and
available statistics from 1980 to 2017 there is a constant scaling
between the rate of primary energy consumption and the sum total of past
global economic production. Further work by Garret et al. (2020, 2022)
confirmed this relation, finding that just *maintaining *existing levels
of economic production requires sustained growth in energy consumption.

<p>^70^ Wiedmann et al. (2015) also found that for every 10% increase in
GDP, the average national material footprint increases by 6%. The global
average material footprint was 10.5 tonnes per capita in 2008.</p>

in resource use will generate an increase in resource consumption rather
than a decrease. This correlation (sometimes termed the “rebound

<p>Obligatory exponential economic growth with externalized harms,
operating on a linear materials economy, employing increasingly powerful
technology is fundamentally incompatible with the natural pace of
ecological regeneration and biospheric stability.</p>
<p>There are many positive and necessary efforts to combat these trends,
including non-profit, governmental, IGO, and impact investment projects
in the commercial sector focused on conservation, renewable energies,
‘closed loop’ economies, and general sustainability.</p>
<p>However, the totality of all of these activities taken together has not
even slowed the rate of overshoot. The situation continues to worsen
year by year. There are still fundamental economic incentives for
extraction, waste, and pollution, and our success at international
environmental agreements has been disappointing at best.</p>
<p>All of these dynamics (discussed further in part two) drive exponential
increases in production and consumption that have run up against real
physical and ecological limits. The</p>
<p>biosphere-civilization relationship is intrinsically (and appropriately)
asymmetric. *<strong>Civilization</strong> **is inherently dependent upon the
biosphere <strong>—</strong> not the other way around. Yet civilization continues to
destroy that which it depends upon for its very existence. ***Absent
efforts to resolve these structural misalignments, ecological overshoot
will continue mostly unabated, leading to increasing global catastrophes
and possibly the uninhabitability of the Earth.</p></article><hr/><div class="page-footer"></div></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div class="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[],&quot;focusOnHover&quot;:false,&quot;enableRadial&quot;:false}"></div><button class="global-graph-icon" aria-label="Global Graph"><svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xml:space="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
