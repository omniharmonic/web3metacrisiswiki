This was a profound turning point in history: humanity had invented a technology powerful enough to pose an immediate threat to all human life. This initiated a new epoch, characterized by the potential for the imminent end of the world at any moment from human action.

During this time there have been no direct wars between major powers, and no further nuclear strikes since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some view this as evidence that our civilization has demonstrated progress at addressing the problem of violence. However, rather than violence disappearing, the fronts of war were simply changing. Nuclear weapons did not bring about the end of war; they ushered in an era of \f3\i1 war by other means\f4\i0 .

Conventional tactics were enveloped within a broader strategy of economic and financial coercion, political interference and regime change, espionage, intelligence gathering, proxy-conflict, insurgency, terrorism, cyber-attacks, and information and population centric warfare. In parallel, smaller nations and non-state actors (e.g., in Vietnam and Afghanistan) were also innovating in irregular tactics in order to contend with these more powerful, nuclear-armed militaries (often in the midst of the proxy wars taking place\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 between\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 them).\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 By\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 means\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 of\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 insurgency,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 guerilla\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 warfare,\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 and\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 decentralized\expnd0\expndtw-1  \expnd0\expndtw0 organization, these groups were able to drive up the economic and political costs of war too high for major powers to bear, forcing withdrawal.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\sl240\slmult1\sb126\f4\fs22\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li360\ri369\sl360\slmult1\f4\fs22\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 Irregular warfare is not totally unprecedented.

Whoever initiates a war is less likely to die in it\super 114\nosupersub , and if they win, they grow in power, write themselves into the history books as the righteous victor, and rule an empire with greater riches. \'93\f3\i1 War is a racket.

They are vastly more complex, seemingly intractable, accelerating at a faster rate, with consequences of equal existential significance. This is in large part because advanced technologies, like AI, are vastly more difficult to contain and control than nuclear weapons. The immense difficulty of manufacturing nuclear weapons initially limited them to only a few major state actors who could be relatively easily monitored.

The general trend is that total nuclear capability is increasing, and the technologies are becoming vastly more sophisticated. Nuclear powers still have strong reason not to initiate a full-scale strike against the other, but the countless close calls during the Cold War remind us that, even in a radically simpler situation, increased suspicions, arms build-up, and military maneuvering are sufficient to bring us to the brink of total war.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\sl240\slmult1\f4\fs20\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\sl240\slmult1\f4\fs20\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\sl240\slmult1\f4\fs20\b0\i0\par
