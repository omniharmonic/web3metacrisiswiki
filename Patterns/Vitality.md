# Vitality

## Definition

**Vitality** is one of the three core design principles for a life-affirming civilization, representing "the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies." It serves as a comprehensive rubric for assessing whether proposed interventions contribute to the creation of a fundamentally more adaptive, equitable, and life-affirming world rather than merely patching failing systems.
