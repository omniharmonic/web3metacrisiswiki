# Meta-crisis

## Definition

The **meta-crisis** is a profound failure of civilizational coordination and adaptation, where our current governing structures are systemically incapable of addressing the existential threats they generate. It is characterized by a nested set of self-reinforcing, exponential feedback loops that not only accelerate existential risks but simultaneously erode our collective capacity to mount a coherent response.

## Core Characteristics

The meta-crisis is not a single problem but a **systemic dysfunction** that manifests through multiple interconnected crises:

- **Regulatory Capture**: Public agencies become co-opted by the industries they regulate
- **Misaligned Incentives**: Individual rational actions aggregate into collectively destructive outcomes  
- **Disinformation via AI**: Erosion of shared reality through synthetic content
- **Mass Surveillance**: Architecture of digital authoritarianism
- **Economic Centralization**: Recursive accumulation of wealth and power

## Generator Functions

The meta-crisis is rooted in **foundational agreements** that structure modern civilization:

- **Rivalrous, zero-sum worldview** encoded into primary coordinating institutions (state and corporation)
- **Extractive behaviors** and enclosure of shared resources
- **Systematic externalization of costs** to the commons
- **Tragedy of the commons** and intractable multi-polar traps

## Three Attractors

Game-theoretic analysis suggests three primary basins of attraction:

1. **Chaos Attractor**: Widespread collapse of institutions, devolution into tribalism and conflict
2. **Authoritarian Attractor**: Techno-fascist consolidation of centralized power
3. **Third Attractor**: Agent-centric self-organization, distributed coordination, and decentralized governance
