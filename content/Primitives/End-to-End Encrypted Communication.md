# End-to-End Encrypted Communication

## Definition

**End-to-End Encrypted Communication** refers to the pattern of communication systems that encrypt data at the sender's device and decrypt it only at the recipient's device, ensuring that no intermediate parties can access the content, often through blockchain technology, tokenization, and decentralized governance systems.
