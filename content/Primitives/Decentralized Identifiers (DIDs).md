## Definition

**Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity. DIDs are designed to be independent of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority, giving users complete control over their digital identity and personal data.

## Core Properties

### Self-Sovereign Identity
- **User control**: Users maintain complete control over their identity
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the identity
- **Verifiable**: Identity claims can be cryptographically verified
- **Portable**: Identity can be used across different platforms
- **Privacy-preserving**: Users control what information to share

### Key Mechanisms
- **DID documents**: Self-describing identity documents
- **Cryptographic keys**: Public-private key pairs for authentication
- **Verifiable credentials**: Cryptographically signed identity claims
- **Selective disclosure**: Sharing only necessary information
- **Revocation**: Ability to revoke identity claims

## Beneficial Potentials

### Privacy and User Control
- **Data sovereignty**: Users control their own data
- **Selective disclosure**: Sharing only necessary information
- **Privacy preservation**: Protecting personal information
- **Consent management**: Users control data sharing
- **Identity portability**: Using identity across platforms

### Security and Trust
- **Cryptographic security**: Strong cryptographic guarantees
- **Tamper-proof**: Identity documents cannot be tampered with
- **Verifiable**: Identity claims can be verified
- **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographic proof of identity
- **Trust networks**: Building trust without central authorities

### New Applications and Use Cases
- **Digital identity**: Self-sovereign digital identity
- **Access control**: Secure access to services
- **KYC/AML**: Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering
- **Credential verification**: Verifying educational and professional credentials
- **Voting systems**: Secure and verifiable voting

## Detrimental Potentials

### Technical and Implementation Challenges
- **Complexity**: More complex than traditional identity systems
- **User experience**: Difficult for non-technical users
- **Integration**: Difficult to integrate with existing systems
- **Standards**: Lack of universal standards
- **Adoption barriers**: High barriers to adoption

### Security and Privacy Risks
- **Key management**: Managing cryptographic keys
- **Identity theft**: Risks of identity theft and fraud
- **Sybil attacks**: Creating fake identities
- **Privacy leaks**: Accidental disclosure of personal information
- **Revocation challenges**: Difficult to revoke compromised identities

### Economic and Social Challenges
- **Economic incentives**: Lack of economic incentives for adoption
- **Network effects**: Need for widespread adoption
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Unclear regulatory status
- **Social acceptance**: Resistance to new identity systems
- **Digital divide**: Excluding users without technical knowledge

## Technical Implementation

### DID Structure
```
