# Sharding

## Definition

**Sharding** is a scaling technique that splits a blockchain into multiple parallel chains (shards), each processing transactions independently. This horizontal scaling approach increases transaction throughput by allowing parallel processing across multiple shards.

## Core Properties

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple shards process transactions simultaneously
- **Independent shards**: Each shard operates independently
- **Cross-shard communication**: Transactions between different shards
- **Shard coordination**: Coordination between shards
- **Load distribution**: Distributing load across shards

### Shard Management
- **Shard assignment**: Assigning transactions to shards
- **Shard rotation**: Rotating validators between shards
- **Shard synchronization**: Synchronizing shard states
- **Shard security**: Securing individual shards
- **Shard governance**: Governing shard operations

## Beneficial Potentials

## Technical Implementation

### Shard Structure
```
Shard = (Shard ID, Validators, Transactions, State)
Cross-Shard Transaction = (From Shard, To Shard, Data)
Shard Coordination = (Shard State, Cross-Shard Communication)
```

### Key Components
