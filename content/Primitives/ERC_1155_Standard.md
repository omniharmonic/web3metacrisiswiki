# ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard

## Definition

**ERC-1155** is a hybrid token standard that enables a single smart contract to manage multiple token types, including both fungible tokens (like [[ERC-20 Standard|ERC-20]]) and non-fungible tokens (like [[ERC-721 Standard (NFTs)|ERC-721]]). This standard was designed to address the limitations of previous token standards by providing a more efficient and flexible approach to token management.

## Core Properties

### Multi-Token Support
- **Fungible tokens**: Interchangeable tokens with quantities
- **Non-fungible tokens**: Unique tokens with individual properties
- **Semi-fungible tokens**: Tokens that can be both unique and quantifiable
- **Batch operations**: Efficient handling of multiple token types
- **Gas optimization**: Reduced transaction costs through batching

### Standardized Interface
- **balanceOf()**: Returns balance of specific token for an address
- **balanceOfBatch()**: Returns balances of multiple tokens for multiple addresses
- **setApprovalForAll()**: Approves or revokes operator for all tokens
- **isApprovedForAll()**: Checks if operator is approved for all tokens
- **safeTransferFrom()**: Transfers specific amount of token
- **safeBatchTransferFrom()**: Transfers multiple tokens in single transaction

## Beneficial Potentials

### Efficiency and Cost Reduction
- **Batch operations**: Multiple token transfers in single transaction
- **Reduced gas costs**: Lower transaction fees through optimization
- **Single contract deployment**: Manage multiple token types with one contract
- **Simplified management**: Easier token administration and updates
- **Scalability**: Better performance for applications with many token types

### Gaming and Virtual Worlds
- **Game items**: Weapons, armor, consumables, and collectibles
- **Inventory management**: Efficient handling of player possessions
- **Trading systems**: Complex item exchange mechanisms
- **Achievement systems**: Unique rewards and progress tracking
- **Virtual economies**: Diverse token types for different purposes

### DeFi and Financial Applications
- **Multi-asset portfolios**: Managing diverse investment tokens
- **Lending protocols**: Collateral management with multiple asset types
- **Yield farming**: Efficient handling of reward tokens
- **Liquidity pools**: Multi-token liquidity provision
- **Derivative products**: Complex financial instruments

### Enterprise and Business Applications
- **Supply chain**: Tracking products, components, and certifications
- **Loyalty programs**: Points, rewards, and membership tokens
- **Event management**: Tickets, access passes, and merchandise
- **Document management**: Certificates, licenses, and credentials
- **Asset management**: Real estate, equipment, and intellectual property

## Detrimental Potentials

### Complexity and Implementation Challenges
- **Technical complexity**: More complex than single-token standards
- **Implementation bugs**: Higher risk of vulnerabilities in complex systems
- **User experience**: More complicated interfaces for end users
- **Development overhead**: Requires more sophisticated smart contract design
- **Testing challenges**: Complex interactions between token types

### Security and Risk Management
- **Attack surface**: Larger attack surface due to complexity
- **Batch operation risks**: Failures can affect multiple token types
- **Approval management**: Complex permission systems
- **Upgrade challenges**: Difficult to modify deployed contracts
- **Audit requirements**: More extensive security auditing needed

### Market and Economic Issues
- **Liquidity fragmentation**: Multiple token types may reduce liquidity
- **Price discovery**: Complex pricing for diverse token types
- **Market manipulation**: Potential for coordinated attacks across token types
- **Regulatory complexity**: Multiple token types may face different regulations
- **Tax implications**: Complex tax treatment of diverse token types

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
interface ERC1155 {
    function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata accounts, uint256[] calldata ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] calldata ids, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

### Batch Operations
- **Batch transfers**: Multiple token transfers in single transaction
- **Batch approvals**: Approve multiple tokens simultaneously
- **Batch queries**: Retrieve multiple token balances efficiently
- **Atomic operations**: All-or-nothing transaction execution
- **Gas optimization**: Reduced costs through batching

## Use Cases and Applications

### Gaming and Entertainment
- **Game economies**: Diverse in-game currencies and items
- **Trading cards**: Collectible and playable card systems
- **Virtual worlds**: Land, buildings, and virtual assets
- **Event tickets**: Access passes and merchandise
- **Streaming platforms**: Subscriptions and exclusive content

### Supply Chain and Logistics
- **Product tracking**: Individual items and batch quantities
- **Quality control**: Certificates and inspection records
- **Inventory management**: Stock levels and item tracking
- **Compliance**: Regulatory and safety certifications
- **Traceability**: Complete product lifecycle tracking

### Financial Services
- **Portfolio management**: Diverse investment vehicles
- **Lending platforms**: Collateral and loan tokens
- **Insurance**: Policy and claim tokens
- **Derivatives**: Complex financial instruments
- **Asset management**: Real estate and commodity tokens
