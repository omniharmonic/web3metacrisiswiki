# Blockchain Oracles / Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs)

## Definition

**Blockchain Oracles** and **Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs)** are secure bridges that connect blockchains to external data sources, enabling smart contracts to access real-world information. They solve the "oracle problem" by providing reliable, tamper-proof data feeds to blockchain applications.

## Core Properties
