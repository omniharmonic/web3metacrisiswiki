# Sidechains

## Definition

**Sidechains** are independent blockchains that are connected to a main blockchain (parent chain) through a two-way bridge, allowing assets to be transferred between chains. They provide scalability and customization while maintaining security through the parent chain.

## Core Properties

### Independent Operation
- **Separate consensus**: Own consensus mechanism
- **Independent governance**: Own governance system
- **Customization**: Optimized for specific use cases
- **Scalability**: Higher transaction throughput
- **Flexibility**: Flexible design and implementation

### Bridge Connections
- **Two-way bridge**: Transfer assets between chains
- **Asset locking**: Locking assets on parent chain
- **Asset minting**: Minting assets on sidechain
- **Asset burning**: Burning assets on sidechain
- **Asset unlocking**: Unlocking assets on parent chain

## Beneficial Potentials

### Scalability and Performance
- **High throughput**: Higher transaction throughput
- **Low latency**: Faster transaction confirmation
- **Low costs**: Lower transaction fees
- **Scalability**: Better scalability than main chain
- **Efficiency**: More efficient transaction processing

### Customization and Innovation
- **Custom consensus**: Custom consensus mechanisms
- **Custom governance**: Custom governance systems
- **Custom features**: Custom features and functionality
- **Innovation**: Innovation in blockchain design
- **Experimentation**: Experimentation with new ideas

### Economic Benefits
- **Cost reduction**: Lower transaction costs
