# Contract Accounts (CAs)

## Definition

**Contract Accounts (CAs)** refers to the pattern of blockchain accounts that are controlled by smart contract code rather than private keys, often through blockchain technology, tokenization, and decentralized governance systems.

## Core Concepts

- **Contract Accounts**: Accounts controlled by smart contracts
- **Smart Contracts**: Code that controls accounts
- **Account Control**: How accounts are controlled
- **Code Execution**: Execution of account code
- **Decentralized**: Not controlled by central authority

## Technical Mechanisms

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Smart Contracts**: Contract account smart contracts
- **Tokenization**: Tokenizing contract accounts
- **Decentralized Systems**: Decentralized contract account systems
- **Cryptographic Security**: Securing contract accounts
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Consensus in contract accounts

### Contract Account Systems
