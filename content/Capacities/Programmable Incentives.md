# Programmable Incentives

## Definition

**Programmable Incentives** is the capacity of blockchain systems to create and manage automated, customizable incentive mechanisms that can be programmed to reward specific behaviors, align interests, and coordinate collective action without requiring central authorities.

## Core Concepts

- **Automated Rewards**: Rewards that are automatically distributed
- **Behavioral Alignment**: Incentives that align individual and collective interests
- **Customizable Logic**: Incentive logic that can be customized
- **Transparent Distribution**: Public, verifiable reward distribution
- **Collective Coordination**: Incentives that coordinate collective action

## Technical Mechanisms

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
- **Automated Execution**: Self-executing incentive mechanisms
- **Conditional Logic**: Incentives based on specific conditions
- **Multi-step Processes**: Complex incentive workflows
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other systems
- **Upgradeability**: Ability to update incentive mechanisms

### Token Economics
- **Token Standards**: Standards for incentive tokens
- **Distribution Mechanisms**: Mechanisms for distributing rewards
- **Staking Systems**: Systems for staking and rewards
- **Governance Tokens**: Tokens for voting on incentives
- **Value Distribution**: Sharing benefits from incentives
