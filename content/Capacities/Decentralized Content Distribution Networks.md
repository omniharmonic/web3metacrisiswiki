# Decentralized Content Distribution Networks

## Definition

**Decentralized Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)** are blockchain-based systems that enable the distributed storage, caching, and delivery of digital content without relying on centralized servers. These networks provide censorship-resistant, globally accessible content delivery that is resistant to single points of failure and control.

## Core Concepts

- **Distributed Storage**: Content stored across multiple nodes
- **Censorship Resistance**: Content cannot be blocked by authorities
- **Global Access**: Content accessible from anywhere worldwide
- **Decentralized Control**: No single entity controls the network
- **Economic Incentives**: Rewards for providing storage and bandwidth

## Technical Mechanisms

### Content Addressing
- **Content Identifiers (CIDs)**: Unique identifiers based on content
- **Hash Functions**: Cryptographic fingerprints of content
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient verification of large content datasets
- **IPFS Protocol**: InterPlanetary File System for content addressing
- **Multihash**: Multiple hash algorithms for content identification

### Storage Mechanisms
- **Distributed Storage**: Content replicated across multiple nodes
- **Redundancy**: Multiple copies of content for reliability
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues despite node failures
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of content load across nodes
- **Caching**: Local caching for improved performance

### Economic Systems
- **Storage Rewards**: Economic incentives for providing storage
- **Bandwidth Rewards**: Economic incentives for providing bandwidth
- **Content Markets**: Markets for content storage and delivery
- **Reputation Systems**: Tracking of node performance
