# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

## Definition

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** is the capacity of blockchain systems to provide financial services without relying on traditional financial intermediaries such as banks, brokers, or insurance companies. DeFi enables peer-to-peer financial transactions, lending, borrowing, trading, and other financial services through smart contracts and decentralized protocols.

## Core Concepts

## Technical Mechanisms

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
- **Automated Execution**: Self-executing financial agreements
- **Conditional Logic**: Financial behavior based on specific conditions
- **Multi-step Processes**: Complex financial workflows
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other systems
- **Upgradeability**: Ability to update financial protocols

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20 Tokens**: Fungible tokens for financial assets
- **ERC-721 Tokens**: Non-fungible tokens for unique assets
