# Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Tokens

## Definition

**Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Tokens** are digital assets that represent and monetize the value of natural ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, and environmental services. These tokens enable the creation of markets for ecosystem services, providing economic incentives for conservation and sustainable environmental management.

## Core Concepts

- **[[Ecosystem Services]]**: Natural benefits provided by ecosystems to humans
- **Biodiversity Conservation**: Protection and restoration of biological diversity
- **[[Environmental Markets]]**: Economic mechanisms for environmental protection
- **[[Tokenized Ecosystem Services]]**: Digital representation of natural assets
- **Conservation Incentives**: Economic rewards for environmental stewardship

## Technical Mechanisms

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20 Tokens**: Fungible tokens representing ecosystem service units
- **ERC-721 Tokens**: Non-fungible tokens for specific natural assets
- **ERC-1155 Tokens**: Multi-token standard for diverse ecosystem assets
- **Custom Standards**: Specialized tokens for specific ecosystem services
- **Cross-Chain Tokens**: Interoperable tokens across different blockchains

### Measurement and Verification
