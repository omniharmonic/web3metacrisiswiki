# Byzantine Fault Tolerance

## Definition

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** is the capacity of distributed systems to continue operating correctly even when some nodes fail or behave maliciously. Named after the Byzantine Generals' Problem, BFT ensures that a distributed system can reach consensus and maintain security even when up to one-third of the nodes are faulty or adversarial.

## Core Concepts

- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating despite node failures
- **Malicious Behavior**: Resistance to nodes that intentionally act against the system
- **[[Distributed Consensus]]**: Agreement among honest nodes despite faulty ones
- **Security**: Protection against various attack vectors
- **[[Reliability]]**: Consistent operation under adverse conditions

## Technical Mechanisms

### Consensus Algorithms
- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**: Classic BFT consensus algorithm
- **Tendermint**: BFT consensus with immediate finality
- **HotStuff**: BFT consensus with linear communication complexity
- **Casper**: BFT consensus with economic security
- **Avalanche**: Probabilistic BFT consensus

### Fault Models
- **Crash Failures**: Nodes that stop responding
- **Byzantine Failures**: Nodes that behave arbitrarily
- **Network Partitions**: Temporary network splits
- **Timing Attacks**: Attacks exploiting timing vulnerabilities
- **Sybil Attacks**: Single entity controlling multiple nodes

### Security Properties
- **Safety**: System never reaches invalid states
- **Liveness**: System eventually makes progress
- **Finality**: Once decided, decisions cannot be reversed
- **Validity**: Only valid transactions are accepted
- **Agreement**: All honest nodes agree on the same state

## Beneficial Potentials
