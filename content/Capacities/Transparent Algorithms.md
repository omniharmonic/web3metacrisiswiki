# Transparent Algorithms

## Definition and Epistemic Significance

**Transparent Algorithms** represents code-based accountability\u2014making decision-making logic publicly auditable through open source smart contracts. This capability challenges assumptions about whether algorithmic transparency enables oversight, how code visibility affects gaming, and whether technical auditability translates to practical understanding.

The significance extends beyond technical implementation to encompass tensions between transparency and competitive advantage, whether open algorithms prove more trustworthy than audited proprietary ones, and the political economy where transparency may enable sophisticated gaming while excluding non-technical stakeholders from meaningful oversight.
