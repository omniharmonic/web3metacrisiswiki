# Programmability

## Definition

**Programmability** in Web3 systems refers to the ability to encode complex logic and automate processes through smart contracts and other programmable mechanisms. This capability enables the creation of "unstoppable" applications that operate independently of any single controlling entity while maintaining mathematical guarantees about their behavior and execution.

## Technical Foundation

### Smart Contract Execution
- **Automated execution**: Programs that run automatically when conditions are met
- **Deterministic behavior**: Identical inputs always produce identical outputs
- **Immutability**: Code cannot be changed once deployed
- **Transparency**: All code and execution is publicly verifiable

### Virtual Machine Environment
- **Sandboxed execution**: Isolated execution environment preventing interference
- **Resource metering**: Gas system preventing infinite loops and resource exhaustion
- **State management**: Persistent state across contract executions
- **Interoperability**: Contracts can call other contracts and share data

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- **Mathematical security**: Security derived from cryptographic properties
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify contract behavior independently
- **Immutability**: Code cannot be altered after deployment
- **Transparency**: All execution is publicly auditable

### Regulatory and Legal Challenges
- **Legal status**: Uncertain legal status of smart contracts
- **Enforcement**: Difficulty enforcing smart contract terms
- **Dispute resolution**: Limited mechanisms for resolving disputes
- **Regulatory compliance**: Challenges with regulatory requirements

## Technical Implementation
