# Decentralized Information Commons

## Definition

**Decentralized Information Commons** is the capacity of blockchain systems to create and maintain shared information resources that are collectively owned, managed, and governed by communities without central authorities. This enables the creation of public goods for information that are accessible, sustainable, and resistant to censorship.

## Core Concepts

- **Collective Ownership**: Information resources owned by communities
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making about information
- **Public Goods**: Information that benefits everyone
- **Censorship Resistance**: Information that cannot be easily suppressed

- **Smart Contracts**: Automated governance and management
- **Token Economics**: Incentivizing participation and maintenance
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Deciding on information validity and updates

### Information Management
- **Content Addressing**: Information identified by its content
- **Version Control**: Tracking changes to information
- **Access Control**: Managing who can read and modify information
- **Metadata**: Information about information for organization
