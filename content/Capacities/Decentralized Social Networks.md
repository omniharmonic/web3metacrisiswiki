# Decentralized Social Networks

## Definition

**Decentralized Social Networks** is the capacity of blockchain systems to create social networking platforms that are not controlled by central authorities, enabling users to own their data, control their social connections, and participate in governance without relying on traditional social media companies.

## Core Concepts

- **User Ownership**: Users own their social data and connections
- **Decentralized Control**: No single entity controls the network
- **Censorship Resistance**: Social content cannot be easily suppressed
