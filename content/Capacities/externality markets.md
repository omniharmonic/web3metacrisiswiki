# Externality Markets

## Definition and Economic Significance

**Externality Markets** represent an attempt to address market failuresâ€”the capacity to create tradable assets representing environmental and social impacts not captured by conventional markets. This capability challenges assumptions about whether market mechanisms can internalize externalities, who determines externality pricing, and whether tokenization enables or obscures accountability for societal harms.

The significance extends beyond technical implementation to encompass fundamental questions about environmental economics, whether financialization helps or hinders sustainability goals, and the political economy of assigning property rights to atmospheric carbon or ecosystem services.
