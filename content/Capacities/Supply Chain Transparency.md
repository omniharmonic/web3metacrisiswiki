# Supply Chain Transparency

## Definition and Accountability Significance

**Supply Chain Transparency** represents end-to-end visibilityâ€”the capacity to track products through complex supply chains via blockchain recording rather than institutional oversight. This capability challenges assumptions about whether transparency requires immutable records, how visibility affects accountability, and whether technical tracking solves coordination problems that prove fundamentally social.

The significance extends beyond technical implementation to encompass oracle problems in physical-digital bridging, whether transparency benefits consumers or enables surveillance, and the political economy of supply chains where transparency costs concentrate on producers while benefits accrue to retailers and consumers.

Note: See also [[Provenance Tracking]] for related analysis of immutability and authentication challenges.
