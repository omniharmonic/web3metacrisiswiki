## Definition

**Privacy preservation** is the capacity to maintain confidentiality, anonymity, and control over personal information while still enabling verification, authentication, and participation in digital systems. It represents a fundamental shift from surveillance-based to privacy-preserving digital infrastructure.

## Core Principles

### Data Minimization
- **Selective disclosure**: Share only necessary information
- **Purpose limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **Retention limits**: Delete data when no longer needed
- **Consent-based**: Explicit permission for data use

### User Control
- **Self-sovereignty**: Users own and control their data
- **Portability**: Ability to move data between systems
- **Deletion rights**: Right to have data removed
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of data use

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Prove statements without revealing information
- **Homomorphic encryption**: Compute on encrypted data
- **Differential privacy**: Statistical privacy guarantees
- **Secure multi-party computation**: Joint computation without revealing inputs

## Privacy-Preserving Technologies

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
- **Selective disclosure**: Prove attributes without revealing underlying data
- **Identity verification**: Prove eligibility without revealing identity
- **Transaction privacy**: Hide transaction details while maintaining validity
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements while preserving privacy

### Decentralized Identity
- **Self-sovereign identity**: Users control their own identity data
- **Verifiable credentials**: Cryptographically secure credentials
- **Selective disclosure**: Share only necessary information
- **Interoperability**: Work across different systems and platforms

### Privacy-Preserving Computation
- **Secure multi-party computation**: Joint computation without revealing inputs
- **Homomorphic encryption**: Compute on encrypted data
- **Differential privacy**: Statistical privacy guarantees
- **Federated learning**: Train models without sharing raw data

### Anonymous Communication
- **Tor networks**: Anonymous communication routing
- **Mix networks**: Anonymous message mixing
- **Private messaging**: End-to-end encrypted communication
- **Anonymous voting**: Private participation in governance

## Beneficial Potentials

- **User interfaces**: Privacy-preserving applications and tools

### Legal and Regulatory
- **Privacy laws**: Strong legal protections for privacy
- **Data protection**: Comprehensive data protection regulations
- **Right to be forgotten**: Ability to have data deleted
- **Consent mechanisms**: Clear and informed consent processes

### Economic Design
- **Privacy tokens**: Economic incentives for privacy preservation
- **Privacy markets**: Markets for privacy-preserving services
- **Reputation systems**: Privacy-preserving reputation and trust
- **Governance**: Privacy-preserving governance mechanisms

### Social and Cultural
- **Privacy education**: Understanding of privacy rights and technologies
