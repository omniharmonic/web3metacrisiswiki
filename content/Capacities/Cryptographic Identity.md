# Cryptographic Identity

## Definition

**Cryptographic Identity** is the capacity of blockchain systems to create and manage digital identities using cryptographic techniques, enabling users to prove their identity and attributes without revealing sensitive personal information. This allows for privacy-preserving, self-sovereign identity systems that are resistant to surveillance and control.

## Technical Mechanisms

### Cryptographic Techniques
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic proof of identity
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verification without revealing data
- **Hash Functions**: Immutable linking of identity data
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient verification of large identity datasets
