# Portability

## Definition

**Portability** is the capacity of blockchain systems to enable users to move their assets, data, and identity across different platforms, networks, and applications without losing ownership or functionality. It ensures that users are not locked into specific systems and can freely choose where to store and use their digital assets.

## Core Concepts

- **Asset Portability**: Ability to move assets between platforms
- **Data Portability**: Transfer of personal data across systems
- **Identity Portability**: Moving digital identity between platforms
- **Platform Independence**: Not locked into specific systems
- **Interoperability**: Seamless operation across different networks

## Technical Mechanisms

- **[[Bridge_Protocols]]**: Transferring assets between [[Blockchain]]s
- **[[Atomic_Swaps]]**: Direct exchanges between different networks
- **[[Interoperability]] Standards**: Common protocols for different systems
- **Multi-Chain Wallets**: Single interface for multiple networks
- **Cross-Chain Applications**: Applications that work across networks

### Data Portability
- **Export Functions**: Ability to download personal data
