# Credential Verification

## Definition

**Credential Verification** is the capacity of blockchain systems to verify the authenticity, validity, and integrity of digital credentials, certificates, and attestations without relying on centralized authorities. This enables trustless verification of qualifications, achievements, and claims while preserving privacy and preventing fraud.

## Core Concepts
