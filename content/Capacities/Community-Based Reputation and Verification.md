# Community-Based Reputation and Verification

## Definition

**Community-Based Reputation and Verification** is the capacity of blockchain systems to enable communities to collectively build, maintain, and verify reputation systems without centralized authorities. This allows for decentralized trust mechanisms, peer-to-peer verification, and community-driven quality assessment that can scale globally while maintaining local context and values.
