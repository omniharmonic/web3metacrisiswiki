# Transparency

## Definition

**Transparency** is the capacity to make information, processes, and decisions visible, auditable, and accessible to relevant stakeholders. In Web3 systems, transparency is achieved through public blockchains, open-source code, and cryptographic verification, enabling trustless coordination and accountability.

## Core Properties

### Public Visibility
- **Open access**: Information available to anyone with internet connection
- **Real-time data**: Information updated in real-time as events occur
- **Historical records**: Complete audit trail of all past activities
- **Global reach**: Accessible from anywhere in the world

### Cryptographic Verification
- **Mathematical guarantees**: Cryptographic proofs of data integrity
- **Immutable records**: Data cannot be altered or deleted once recorded
- **Verifiable authenticity**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of information
- **Tamper resistance**: Cryptographic security prevents data manipulation

### Automated Execution
- **Smart contracts**: Automated execution of predefined rules
- **Transparent logic**: All business logic publicly auditable
- **Predictable outcomes**: Same input always produces same output
- **No human intervention**: Eliminates human error and bias
