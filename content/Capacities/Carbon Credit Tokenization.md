# Carbon Credit Tokenization

## Definition

**Carbon Credit Tokenization** is the capacity of blockchain systems to create digital tokens that represent verified carbon credits, enabling transparent, liquid, and globally accessible carbon markets. These tokens facilitate the trading, tracking, and retirement of carbon credits while ensuring environmental integrity and preventing double-counting.

## Core Concepts

- **Carbon Credits**: Verified units of carbon reduction or removal
- **Tokenization**: Digital representation of carbon credits on blockchain
- **Carbon Markets**: Trading platforms for carbon credits
- **Environmental Integrity**: Ensuring real and additional carbon benefits
- **Double-Counting Prevention**: Avoiding multiple claims for same carbon benefit

## Technical Mechanisms

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20 Tokens**: Fungible tokens representing carbon credits
- **ERC-721 Tokens**: Non-fungible tokens for specific carbon projects
- **ERC-1155 Tokens**: Multi-token standard for diverse carbon assets
- **Custom Standards**: Specialized tokens for specific carbon markets
- **Cross-Chain Tokens**: Interoperable tokens across different blockchains

### Verification and Monitoring
- **Satellite Monitoring**: Remote sensing for carbon project verification
- **IoT Sensors**: Internet of Things devices for real-time monitoring
