# Immutable Provenance

## Definition

**Immutable Provenance** is the capacity of blockchain systems to create permanent, unchangeable records of the origin, history, and chain of custody of assets, products, or data, ensuring that provenance information cannot be altered or tampered with once recorded.

## Core Concepts

- **Origin Tracking**: Recording the original source of assets
- **Chain of Custody**: Tracking ownership and transfer history
- **Historical Record**: Permanent record of all changes
- **Verification**: Ability to verify provenance claims
- **Transparency**: Public access to provenance information

## Technical Mechanisms

### Blockchain Infrastructure

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Ensuring data integrity
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated provenance tracking
- **Token Economics**: Incentivizing accurate provenance
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Deciding on provenance validity

### Provenance Tracking
- **Asset Identification**: Unique identification of assets
- **Transfer Records**: Records of all transfers
