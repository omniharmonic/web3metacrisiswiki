0:01 - Kevin Owocki
Are you working outside also?

0:03 - Benjamin Life
No. OK.

0:04 - Unidentified Speaker
He believed it, though.

0:05 - Kevin Owocki
Zoom backgrounds?

0:06 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

0:06 - Kevin Owocki
I got to get a better background, actually, if I'm going to keep working here. Maybe I'll switch my camera so that there's nature behind me or something like that.

0:16 - Unidentified Speaker
This is my backyard.

0:18 - Kevin Owocki
It'd be much cooler if I had, like, actual nature behind me.

0:31 - Unidentified Speaker
Here we go.

0:49 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Howdy, gentlemen. Hi, Daniel. How are you? Good. Good to see you both. Likewise. Before we continue, we've got a Read AI note taker in the call.

1:02 - Kevin Owocki
It just kind of helps me organize my thoughts after the call. But if you wanted, we could kick it out. I'm not sure how sensitive the conversation we're going to have is.

1:18 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
We can keep it. Let me see if I can get my other video camera to work.

1:29 - Unidentified Speaker
Give me a second.

1:32 - Unidentified Speaker
Sure.

1:33 - Kevin Owocki
There we go.

1:35 - Kevin Owocki
Okay. How's it going?

1:38 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Kevin, good to see you, my friend. It's going well.

1:45 - Unidentified Speaker
How you been?

1:47 - Kevin Owocki
It's kind of a transition time right now, kind of trying to figure out what this Gitcoin 3.0 stuff is, and that's been a little stressful, but really feeling invigorated by the work and sort of ignited by purpose and community. Benjamin and I have actually been working out of a co-working space in downtown Boulder, Colorado together, and that's been really great to be working with him and OpenCivics on some of this stuff. I don't know if you have any plans to come to Boulder, but we could definitely host you in our common space if you ever have any interest in that. And builders are such a great nexus for doing this kind of work. Lots of really smart, interesting people around.

2:25 - Unidentified Speaker
How about you?

2:26 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Well, I am happy that we are talking as you figure out what to do with Gitcoin next. I think this is good. And Benjamin, it's good to see you. I think we spoke last. I think you reached out to me recently and then I've been And we spoke last in Austin.

2:46 - Benjamin Life
That's right, on our way out of the Emerge after party. I think we said goodbye to you in summer.

2:55 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
And you were just with Sophia in Indonesia. We were. That was good. So you guys are both in Boulder.

3:04 - Benjamin Life
How are you like in Boulder? I'm really excited about what's happening. Here. It feels like a lot of the kind of builder energy from in the Bay Area, I think the Bay Area is just very saturated. And I think a lot of people have either moved to Boulder or Austin or Asheville. I'm biased because those were kind of the three places I was entertaining. I'm grateful to have chosen Boulder primarily because I think there's There's just a lot of mature projects and people that are doing work here. And you still have the kind of integrally informed metamodern kind of scene, but it's a little bit less in the kind of woo adjacent and more on the kind of practical builders, people creating things, entrepreneurial energy, but still in that kind of systems change orientation. So yeah. The coworking space that Kevin and I helped to start, and Kevin's been the primary backer of, has really created a scene of developers and builders here who are all very values-aligned. So yeah, a lot of cool things are happening here.

4:22 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
I'm from Colorado, and I love Colorado. I was born between Denver and Boulder. And I'm supposed to come to Boulder before too long, so I'll get to come see you guys in person.

4:36 - Kevin Owocki
That'd be great. Yeah, let us know when you have dates.

4:40 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Shall we dive on in to the work you guys started doing following, Kevin, the conversation we had last? Yeah, that sounds great.

4:48 - Kevin Owocki
I've got the doc up in a tab on my screen. And so, you know, I suppose what we could do is that we could sort of present to you the work that we've done so far.

5:02 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
We could do and then we can see where to go from there.

5:06 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

5:06 - Kevin Owocki
Yeah, sounds good. Um, and then just a time check. I know that we only have 45 minutes. So maybe we'll aim to present for 15 minutes and kind of see how that flows and aim to save some time for discussion on the back half the call. Does that work framing wise?

5:21 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Yeah, I have I can go an hour from now if you guys can. Okay, let's do it.

5:26 - Kevin Owocki
Um, Benjamin, I don't want to put you on the spot, but you offered the doc.

5:30 - Kevin Owocki
Do you to walk us through what you're thinking here?

5:36 - Benjamin Life
Sure. I would say the main high-level overview would be this invocation of Web 3 as a design space in which the third attractor or where the third attractor might emerge, primarily because of our ability to engineer mechanisms with alternative incentive landscapes and to have incentives that are more holistic than our current financial system, as well as this kind of trust layer and kind of collective action layer that enables the kind of distributed coordination that the third attractor implies.

6:28 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Um Yeah, maybe I'll start should I go A click layer deeper or or doing a stop at each click just to verify we're on the same page I The way I framed it to Kevin is a little different than that which is not is web3 a design space for um third attractor to arise comprehensively, which I think is too hard a task. But to say, of important problems to solve in the world, what can Web3 really do? Is there anything in Web3 that can do any really important thing? And to start with collecting all the claims that have been made about some Web3 tech could do some important thing, and then let's try to red team those and see which ones are solid. Because of course, to design a world system, is all of infrastructure, all of social structure, and all of superstructure. And that's going to involve all kinds of technologies. So it's not reasonable to ask any technology suite to be the place in which a civilization emerges. But to say, what are the Web 3 affordances that are actually important and worth pursuing? And then what are the things that are claimed? I'm just as interested in what are the blockchain something or other can save the world bullshit. Let's kill all of that and have no one waste time on our, with our endorsement on those things. And then the, these are actually legitimate and valuable use cases, but let's not bullshit or exaggerate what they can do. But they are also, did we lose Kevin? And then we got them back. So there's like, total bullshit is one category. There's, this does some valuable thing, but not particularly better than some other kind of tech does. So the novelty value is relatively low. Then here's where it does some valuable thing that is really, it does a lot better than other tech does. And then maybe the subset of that last, which is highest leverage, most useful things that it can do towards the hardest, most significant problems. I think as an offering, the space of blockchain for good, dot dot dot, it's the most valuable thing that could happen is an actual assessment of all those claims and categorizing them accordingly and saying, if you're working on this set, you're confused or lying. If you're working on these sets, you're probably wasting time if you want to do legitimate shit here. And if you're thinking of putting in money or supporting anyone's activity or having it partner with your foundation or your regenerative, whatever, it should only be one of these types of things or make a counterclaim. So that's what I'm looking for.

9:38 - Unidentified Speaker
Does that match?

9:41 - Kevin Owocki
Great, yeah. I was gonna show, oh, go ahead.

9:44 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
If we're saying what positive things can Web3 stuff do, it doesn't mean that it can do that without concrete or without the written word or without AI or without hardware or without lots of other types of tech.

10:00 - Kevin Owocki
So it's just what affordances are there that are interesting. So just to sort of like ground us a little bit in the proposal, At the very top here, the way I had framed this when Benjamin and I started working on this, what, like two months ago, was starting with what is crypto for, and then articulating and red teaming and blue teaming the things that crypto advocates say it should do, and what is the problem it solves, why is it the right solution, and why would it work when nothing else has? And then secondarily, how do we transition the global financial system from where it is now to something more aligned?

10:38 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
And I'm not sure if- Those are huge jumps, because the second question, how do you transition to global financialism, that's a big and important question that may or may not have much to do with blockchain or crypto. To say what role can crypto play in the transition of the global financial system, I think is a better and more realistic question. Right.

11:07 - Unidentified Speaker
OK.

11:08 - Kevin Owocki
I mean, to me, it feels like we're feeling the same elephant, maybe from different angles. But I think it's important to reiterate your frame at the top, Daniel.

11:21 - Benjamin Life
And I'm happy to kind of go through some of the primitives that we did list with the red team, blue team orientation. And I can kind of select for where I think the highest value might be. Great.

11:38 - Kevin Owocki
And as we do that, I guess I just want to like, before we do that, like, I don't know if we sort of like show up as crypto bros to the table, but like my, my mainframe is like an earnest exploration of the design space and crypto is one tool along with AI. And many others that I think that we can use here. And so it's about earnestly solving the problem. And crypto is only one set of primitives, I think.

12:02 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So I think asking the question of, let's say that you, let's say that I gave you some design docs that we've done on what the necessary and sufficient criteria for a third attractor are that address all the generative dynamics of the other two shady attractors. And then you're going to say, what are the total set of technologies? Social, physical, computational. Or even the subset called, what are the total set of computational technologies that would be useful or necessary in being able to do this? That's obviously a much more robust question. But as far as coming from crypto, and as far as offering something valuable to the crypto space, crypto for good, overarching assessment. I think if I was going to offer any single thing the crypto for good space, it would be an assessment of all crypto for good claims, categorize them, validate them, and then say, there's a lot of for good that can be done better through other tech do other fucking things. There are some crypto for good things that are actually really valuable, but they still have to be, they still have to connect to other kinds of tech. It's not there are other comms channels and other things that are gonna be part of it. But I think if you could have like a definitive get circulate it everywhere. Here's an assessment of what the public good crypto space really looks like, The good, the bad and the ugly. I think it would, there'd be like a before and after that thing to the history of the space. And I think GitHub is the place to do it. Great. Yeah.

13:48 - Kevin Owocki
So just to say that back to you, and this is gonna be super reductionist, but it sounds like the deliverable here that we're aiming for is an assessment from Dennis Maxenberger and and co this group of crypto for good and like stop wasting your time here double down here and and that will inform future design of that space hopefully in the history of of the crypto for good region blah blah yes but I'd modify the by whom I would say the get coin community is delivering this, and Daniel and a few people are advisors looking at this, so I will have signed off on, yes, from the Metacrisis perspective, these things that make it through to the good are actually good, right?

14:38 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
But you might have Vitalik and a few other people sign off from other perspectives. I think it should be GitHub offering this as the beginning of whatever else it does in the next phase with some advisors weighing in on, yes, this is well done. Okay, great.

14:55 - Kevin Owocki
That sounds good. The only thing that I would just add is that I wouldn't make this ask until we had confidence in the deliverable, but it will make way more of a splash if I'm able to have some sort of deliverable with you and Vitalik prominently in it. Like the podcast episodes we did, I think made a big splash. It could be me.

15:19 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
and Vitalik and Andre Tang interest on all the way in on it.

15:24 - Kevin Owocki
Great. That'd be amazing.

15:26 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
But not until we feel good about the thing. Yeah, let's do the thing. And then we could all say, fucking finally, we can stop talking about this nonsense and talk about the things that are actually useful and finally actually incentivize the people to work on the useful parts.

15:45 - Unidentified Speaker
Great.

15:45 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Okay, that's clear. And probably Glenn Weil as well on that list. Great.

15:51 - Kevin Owocki
All people that I have relationships with and work with minus, I think Tristan is the only one I don't have a relationship with there, but sounds good.

16:01 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
He will be here in the next couple of days.

16:05 - Unidentified Speaker
OK, great.

16:06 - Kevin Owocki
OK, so I'm really excited. I'm excited to see.

16:09 - Unidentified Speaker
OK, cool.

16:10 - Kevin Owocki
I just felt like it was useful to touch on the end goal before we went too far. So go ahead.

16:20 - Benjamin Life
Cool, so kind of at the foundational primitives level is the technology behind zero knowledge proofs, seeing this as essential to leveraging the benefits of a global public distributed ledger while preserving privacy as sort of one of the foundational potential misalignments with the technology that I think a lot, there's actually been a lot of pushback recently amongst some of the MAGA adjacent communities around crypto because they're starting to see it as this kind of global surveillance tool, which is a very valid critique. Edward Snowden recently specifically called out Solana because of the degree of centralization there. The rise of Coinbase is also kind of bringing to bear like there's a lot of centralization risks within crypto right now. And so zero knowledge proofs is one technological substrate that would allow for privacy to be preserved and to also have verifiable credentials. And so this solves multiple challenges in that it allows you to have the provenance of a particular attestation of, you know, this piece of information. I verified this piece of information, but I don't need to disclose the entirety of my digital identity in order to create that data provenance. Another would be the way in which tokenization can be utilized for externality pricing. I think this is, I think the red team, blue team here is, we've mostly seen tokenization leading to misaligned incentives and the phenomenon of community as exit liquidity is quite well understood now that a lot of the early VC investment in crypto ended up using retail investors to recoup their investments. And so we haven't seen very much authentic asset-based tokenization or externality-based tokenization. Obviously, that would need to pair with compliance markets that are created through government regulation. So the voluntary externality pricing is probably also a risk that that just doesn't take off and or that it unintentionally kind of like red did with indigenous communities and protecting the forest. These unintended consequences of tokenizing something is also something that should be actively academically understood in terms of how to do externality pricing. That actually produces the desired result. We've also been doing a lot of stuff around community-based funding infrastructure through DAOs, this idea of subsidiarity and democratic control of resource allocation, the idea being that DAOs enable people closer to the problems to have decision-making rights in the allocation of resources. Obviously DAOs have mostly been used to manage treasuries of layer 2 blockchain foundations, and not a lot has been done in terms of flow funding, but the bioregional movement is also starting to experiment with how resources could be cascaded down to the most local level. So there's this kind of direct democratic participation We could go a little bit into UBI, where the zero knowledge identity would be necessary to disambiguate UBI from the kind of surveillance, social credit, security state considerations. Yeah, what am I?

20:28 - Kevin Owocki
Yes, Kevin.

20:29 - Kevin Owocki
like a point of process question, which is like, for you, Daniel, would you prefer to go primitive by primitive and sort of like give feedback each individually? Would you have, would you prefer for Benjamin to keep sort of rattling off ideas up and down the complexity index, and then you can kind of jump in when you get your feedback? Which is good.

20:49 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
And I have a general sense of feedback. So give me the rest of what you've got at this level. And so I get the whole gestalt.

20:59 - Unidentified Speaker
Cool.

21:00 - Benjamin Life
Then we start getting a little bit higher up the stack. Oh, the last thing is around DMRV. There's a lot of challenges for impact reporting and how do we create non-financial markets for impact to align incentives around these sort of pro-social outcomes. And Ethereum attestation service as a primitive allows any agent to attest to any data that is hashed using a particular schema. And EAS is totally schema agnostic. You can add any schema. And so it provides a kind of substrate for impact reporting where instead of kind of big bloated multinational impact verifiers that kind of can't actually process the complexity of the work that's happening. Having peer-to-peer impact attestations is maybe the last primitive that I'll share in terms of having a sufficient degree of ability to manage the complexity by more fully decentralizing reporting and verification of impact and being able to create distinct units of impact through NFTs, which could be basically having fungible and non-fungible representations of non-financial assets.

22:32 - Benjamin Life
I was just going to offer to the group what I consider to be a navigational device in the space.

22:43 - Kevin Owocki
I look at the space as sort of like an assemblage of different money Legos or primitives. At the base layer, there's Nakamoto Consensus, Satoshi's innovation, allowing us to have a distributed ledger, invented all of this. On top of that, you can build tokens, non-fungible tokens, privacy things with ZK circuits. Allows for decentralized file storage. And so just the navigational device that I would offer to this group is sort of the complexity index of where in the stack are we. I think that creating a good understanding with you, Daniel, Foundational primitives like the basic building blocks will allow us to play jazz in that combinatorial design space of of what's possible and I think that what we really want to do is identify the possible and really good and bring that into the present and the plausible of of that design space and so that's just a navigational space device that I wanted to offer to the group as Benjamin's sort of playing jazz on this on this really design space.

23:48 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
If you were to define for me the core distinction features of web 3 tech writ large from Nakamoto through NFTs through zero-knowledge proofs whatever, how would you define web 3 tech as a tech that these things and not these things?

24:11 - Kevin Owocki
I think it's coordination with without capture is the primary invention here.

24:17 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
I don't know, Benjamin, if you agree. Coordination without capture is the outcome that it aims to do, but what is the actual causal mechanisms?

24:27 - Kevin Owocki
Distributed consensus? Sorry, I think there was some latency. I just said distributed consensus, I think, is the primary invention that Satoshi has offered that created this whole space. I think that's the mechanism that creates it. Your query correctly?

24:44 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Distributed consensus via the technological innovation is a kind of cryptography. I think it was originally proof of work, which Satoshi invented in the Bitcoin white paper.

24:55 - Kevin Owocki
I think that the Ethereum branch of the tree views proof of work as unnecessarily spending of electric resources and creation of carbon. And so there's a branch within the Ethereum space that believes in proof of stake. Because you can run an entire blockchain network on just a few kilowatts. So it sort of depends on which branch of the cryptosphere you're in. And there's a bunch of other bespoke consensus algorithms, but within Ethereum, it's proof of stake.

25:30 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So proof of work and proof of stake are both trying to achieve decentralized consensus via a computational verification, decentralized computation for decentralized consensus. Via some algorithm.

25:42 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes.

25:43 - Unidentified Speaker
So the key is some cryptographic process for decentralized consensus.

25:49 - Kevin Owocki
Yeah, and I also say like, yeah, some process, but then there's a, it's composable, which allows anyone to build their own sort of like logical circuits on top of it. Top of that consensus. So that extendability creates the design space that Benjamin and I were talking about at the top.

26:18 - Benjamin Life
Whereas Bitcoin just maintains a ledger of currency, the programmability of smart contracts allows you to have the benefit of a global consensus layer for any type of data that you want to store there. There's distinct around Holochain and peer-to-peer. I think those are very interesting to explore. And there's sort of evolutionary reason for blockchain's emergence and the DeFi drivers of it. And so I don't think either Kevin or I are purists in believing that this global ledger is good for everything, but there are specific things that you do need consensus on. And those are the things that are better to be built in blockchain, whereas more local first technology that enables direct peer to peer syncing of information, you don't need that third party intermediary to verify the information as it passes between the two nodes.

27:18 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Meaning where there is trust, you don't need a trustless process. Exactly. So if what you're seeking is consensus, you either have trust or you don't, if you don't give out And in terms of decentralized consensus, does what, so decentralized consensus on where the chain is, is a fairly straightforward thing. The chain compiles and computes. The consensus has to be on things that compile and compute. That involve interpretability.

27:59 - Benjamin Life
There is an interesting intersubjective component where you can determine a kind of heuristic for that warm data through attestation. That's why I wanted to make sure EIS got mentioned because things that are harder to, you know, like you have IoT or some verifiable sensor data you're bringing in, there are ways of reporting information that is harder to compute and using the kind of social validation to maintain that consensus of the veracity of that information.

28:36 - Kevin Owocki
The thing that I was just going to offer here, Daniel, is that this is an ongoing space of research within the blockchain community. This is what's called the Oracle problem, which is, you know, say you have some data and you put it on chain. Who pays for that? How do you know can trust that person? Can you create a distributed network of oracles where you know that they're not lying because you know they're plural to each other? So this is an active area of research and I think it's necessary but not sufficient to solve this problem to figure out how to take data actually about the world and put it on chain and do useful things with it.

29:19 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So let's say Elon does this and people are trying to figure out if it was a SIG Heil or not.

29:30 - Unidentified Speaker
And everybody has seen.

29:32 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So we're trying to look at meaning making that is consequential around a thing. So first thing is we could assess was that a deepfake or not. And we could use some technologies to do that. We could verify technology. And we could use then some kind of system to assess. We all agree there's consensus that this video is a real video. But then this video means. Now to get to consensus on that, how would you do that? Because most things about governance, the letter and the spirit of the law are radically different and everything is in the domain of interpretation. Like almost all things that happen in governance is where the letter of the law and the spirit of the law have to be different, which is why courts are so critical.

30:33 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

30:34 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
I mean, I think that, um, interpretation and meaning and focus.

30:39 - Kevin Owocki
Yeah.

30:39 - Kevin Owocki
I mean, I think that, um, I mean, it's interesting to consider this, this thing about Elon because it's so recent and so visceral for all of us. But I guess, for me, the question would be, why would we choose to use distributed consensus on that specific problem? Is there some sort of outcome on the world where the juice is worth the squeeze to leverage all these computational resources to figure that out? I mean, maybe there's some sort of consequence where he gets prosecuted or he loses some amount of clout, because it was a SIGCHI So let's make it more relevant and harder.

31:15 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Let's go back a couple months. He's supposed to, or let's do it now. He keeps his government contract turned on. We're going to try to make some voting system or some collective consensus decision-making around that. Can we even get consensus on what are the true things and what are the shared values about which that would be relevant to the decision. He has these government contracts. These are the competitors to those contracts that could or could not replace them. That provides this level of influence over government and access to information. He's done these things, but then he's done these things, but that indicate what about character and values that is aligned or not aligned with the spirit of the Constitution. So first you have to get, what are all the things? Are these relevant or not relevant? What do they mean? How do you weight them relative to each other? What value? So when we start to get to things like real political economy, it's always messy shit like this. So this is some of what I'm asking is, it's typically where it's all stuff that doesn't compile or compute well, because what's included, what's not included, how it's weighted, and ultimately all of it towards interpretations and values. Whereas like a numerical thing into a numerical thing, money into money, is literally the easiest case to make an agreement about. Yeah, I think that's fair.

32:50 - Kevin Owocki
And I appreciate that you're sort of painting a view of the amount of complexity here at the start. If I were to offer a moonshot of what I think that world will look like, And Benjamin and I haven't talked about the specific example, so this might be wrong, but just to take a, take a nap at here. I think that in the political economy, uh, in which we were making this decision in a distributed consensus type of way, there would be a body politic that all has voting rights. Um, and certain parts of the body politic would care about whether he did a SIG high or not. Certain would care about Tesla's distributed MRV, uh, Sort of network. So basically how much are they saving the world in carbon? What is their market capitalization? What is the demand for tesla? Is there there'd be distributed consensus on that set of information and the same would be true of spacex and neuralink and the other the other sort of like Companies that he puts forward we would have mapped all the positive and negative externalities of all of his impact um in the world and sig high would be but It sounds so weird to say that out loud but like That specific example would be one of a number of cryptographically verified things that you as the body politic could subscribe to and say that that's gonna augment my voting behavior and that's not. So we would have like a decentralized political economy between the attention economy shit and like the actual verifiable on-chain things. And then from there it becomes sort of a question for the body politic to say like, oh, I care more about this set of data than this other set of data.

34:32 - Benjamin Life
I would just add, I don't think that we want to move towards a reality where these types of meaning making experiences are algorithmically mediated, other than to provide the context that Kevin just described. And I think the zero knowledge proof piece, I think is very important for civic technology stack, because it would allow people to participate prove they're not a bot, and preserve their anonymity. And you kind of need all three of those things in order to have a healthy public discourse on the internet that's not physically bound to atoms and meat space. And so if you had that as an underlying technology that allowed people to participate in sharing their perspectives, perhaps AI would be a way of synthesizing that information or just making that information and visible would help people come to their own conclusion by kind of indexing all of those things, as opposed to kind of trying to determine them algorithmically. Talk to me about why anonymity is critical for that. I mean, traditionally in the public sphere, our votes have been anonymous to prevent political retribution for our voting, which might not be as relevant in these kind of more, not necessarily governmental or more in the kind of pop culture sphere, but I think the ability to remain anonymous in a kind of cypherpunk way is a kind of fundamental human right that preserves our ability to speak, not, I think, Speaking about consequences is one of the trade-offs, but if you have the constraint on that, that you have to prove your humanity before you have the right to be anonymous, then we get some of the best of both worlds in that, where you're at least not overwhelmed by an infinite number of anonymous bots.

36:50 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
The gaining of this is way too much. Let's say that we take each threat model and each goal separately, because there might, you have to find a synergistic satisfier for them. But sometimes you can find one where it's just like a shitty solution to all the things. So a real human, not a bot, that's one problem. Not protecting people from retribution, that's a separate one. So then we have to say retribution by whom, by the state, by other political actors, those are going to be slightly different things. Because to some degree, it's just like, well, how do we make the state more trustworthy? Because if the answer is always we're scared of the state, you can get into a descending hell spiral where there's no good answer. The answer has to be there's something upstream that has to get corrected. But so let's say that I prove that I'm a human, and I am just Right. So and it's we're not talking about voting. We're talking about influencing the basis of the vote, which is putting in information and all the other things. Voting is the very last step. Or let's say I want to get everybody to agree with me on the thing. So I go behind, have them all do that. And they are willing to in an anonymous setting support something they wouldn't otherwise because I paid them off chain. In a town hall, part of what makes the town hall work is that your reputation is taking when you stand up. And one of the key things the founding brothers knew was we know how to do this at a small scale and it will almost certainly fail at a large scale. And part of it is the, uh, you, you do want people to have skin in the game of the shit they say in their backing and supporting. And, um, So as the scale gets larger, the surveillance and the top-down problems become more concerning. And so people want to protect themselves from it, but then the protection from it just lends to a different method of the top-down thing co-opting the anonymous process. So I want to separate out the various goals and the various threat models. And the goal is, you know, the threat model, protecting against it is one of the goals. And then we want to be able to see what is the right solution for this? Well, any of these three could do it. What's the right solution for this? Any of these could and then we say, is there a synergistic solution that addresses all of these? We have to kind of separate it because anonymity is useful in some places and horrible in other places. And so rather than just like a little bit of the best of both, which both basically still means totally sucks. We want to have so like, let's say we're talking about zero knowledge proof subsidiarity. And for instance, is the way that I anticipate the future of ubiquitous surveillance happening, which we've talked about before, but we'll talk about again now. So let's say we have the two problems we're trying to solve at once. One is in, well let's set the context first. The context is advanced fourth industrial revolution tech makes decentralized catastrophes and centralized dystopias both more possible and they both suck. And we want to protect against both. How do we protect against both? Decentralized catastrophes because catastrophe weapons in basements with LLMs and DDTs and stuff, right? And you make bioweapons in the basement or you do cyber attacks on infrastructure. So we kind of have to know what people are doing in their basement where we didn't have to before because they couldn't do super fucked up stuff. So need for more surveillance because of that. But on the other side, AI being able to take all the surveillance data everywhere gives you the ability for a level of centralized dystopic power that no ruler ever could have imagined before. We want to protect against that because that's a hell world and you can never get out once it's happened. So how do you how do you protect against both simultaneously? Third attractor, right? You have two shed attractors that the same suite of tech makes both possible. And they flip-flop on each other. Little bit of decentralized catastrophe and the answer is more top-down surveillance. People freaking out about the draconian top-down surveillance makes more eco-terrorists. And you get in the tractor that is eventually one of the two, un-totalizingly. Okay, so let's say that we have a ubiquitous technological surveillance system as far as sensors and human input on other human and act and limitation on access to get certain things. If you want to be able to buy something that can do gene synthesis, that is recorded, right? But the hard part becomes the DIY information for how to build your own gene synthesis machine is different than a commercial thing being able to do it. And even the DIY versions get increasingly easier. So we already know that if we start sharing kiddie porn right now on here, the FBI will show up at all of our doors. So this does have a backdoor and is being monitored, right? But supposedly it's being monitored in a way that is not for everything all the time. So can you have, can we have a situation where you have different kinds of monitoring? So via the communications channels, the internet channels, sensors and human channels and access channels, but where all that's happening is a zero knowledge proof flag to one level of monitoring up, one level up under subsidiarity, there is a thing to look at, but not what it is. That then grants the subpoenaable information or the warrant for the investigation to occur, but still has to operate through a warrant. There is a second So you have a secondary process that is doing the trust that whenever that's kicked on, the process that is auditing that process is kicked on. So you have an authority auditing the people and you have another process that is auditing the authority that is auditable by the people. So you have a loop closure on power. And you have subsidiarity local police level, not straight up to the FBI or whatever, that then could only go up to the next level of the right trigger occurred. Right. And so you get the benefits of ubiquitous technological surveillance for not having catastrophe weapons, but you also prevent all the dystopias. So we're like, this is an example of one of the use cases that I think actually has to happen. Right. And this requires quite a lot of things, not just the zero knowledge proof, it requires sensors. It requires categorization of types of tech that have to have non-anonymity for the purchase or engagement of the tech, right? It requires categorization of kinds of information where the engagement with that information also creates a flag. It requires the creation of alternate governance structures. This is one of the ones that I would really like to write up because when you, and the key here was that we created two failure modes that drive each other and that the solution to one usually causes the other. So if we just looked at the failure of a top-down control dystopia, we would create a totally anonymous thing that would kill everyone with decentralized catastrophe weapons or vice versa. And so you have to do the not 12 monkeys and not Palantir at the same time, right? I actually think the cryptographic technology of zero-knowledge proof, in addition to the rest of this tech suite and design, is one of those I can't imagine being able to do it without that. It actually must have that. I think any place where law enforcement would have a backdoor on anything, you have to have a zero-knowledge proof thing for the backdoor thing to kick on. Then there's a cryptographic signal where the law enforcement thing can kick on and the check of the law enforcement auxiliary system kicks on simultaneously. So that cryptographic thing has a splitter in it, right? And so you can never say, well, yeah, but law enforcement saw it and the other thing didn't because here we're using the cryptography because there isn't trust with the police not trusting the public, but the public also not trusting the police. Create a process to be able to deal with them. There's actually a few cases like this that I'd like to talk through that I think are the most important ones I know of And I'd like them to be written up because then I'd like them to be able to be critiqued and red-teamed widely and hardened and see if we can actually dial in this is the answer to these things. And then there's a suite of them together that starts to look like how we do voting, how we do proposition development, how we do currency, how we do a lot of those things. But let me come back to what I was using this as an example of I was using this as an example of there's a problem we're trying to solve. It happens to be that there's two different problems that if you try to solve them on their own, you always cause the other one, right? So we actually have to define the problem we're trying to solve face well, and then we're looking at a suite of things that addresses it. When I'm thinking about how we format this work, there's two ways to do it that I think are good. One is, what are the problems we're trying to solve? And this is where I was saying you have to decompose sometimes that there's several different techniques. And sometimes you have to get where the right altitude is. Like, well, we're trying to protect ourselves from government. Is that based on a fundamental inexorable Or is it based on an upstream problem we should have solved somewhere up above in government? Why government is fucked in the first place? And should we do it via anonymity or should we do it via a secondary thing that is overseen in a watchdog group, right? Because then you also have to look at what is the downside of doing it that way. So anytime you propose a, we're going to solve it this way, you also have to say, what is another way we could solve it? And what are the downsides? Of solving it this way. How do you game it? How do you fuck it? And only if you have seen what the downsides are, and that you can mitigate those, and there's no other ways of solving it or obsoleting the problem that are better, do you know that it's a good idea. From a design perspective. Does that make sense? And so that's what I want us to take all this through. I don't ever want to jump to anonymity or consensus. Consensus might not even be the right fuck Right? Majority or meritocracy, depending upon the decision-making protocol. So, we always have to get clear. What are the problems we're trying to solve? Are there several problems within that problem that we have to decompose it to? And then, proposals for how to solve it, alternate proposals, and the problems of the proposals. That's where I would like to go. So, that's one way, is problem-centered first. So, one problem is, there are externalities. And so then we propose, is pricing externalities using a token a good way of doing it? Well, then we have to look at what are the problems of doing it that way and what are the alternate ways to do it that don't involve cryptography and just involve the court system pricing it and using dollars, right? So then we can do the comparative, this solution versus other solutions, the pros and cons of each. So I'd like to do problem, solution, alternate solutions, problems of solutions. That's one frame. The other frame is here's an underlying piece of tech. Here are the affordances it has. What are the good things and bad things that can emerge out of those affordances, right? So one is problem and then looking at various types of tech to solve it. The other is solution. What are the various problems that could solve or make worse? The way you were talking about was halfway between the two. And as a result, it was a little squishy for me. And so if we could come back and say, problem, externalities are outside of the cost equation, we want to solve that. In order to solve that, that means make it, are we just saying make it less likely to do it because it's expensive? Are we saying that the externalities doesn't happen because the cost is the cost to actually repair it and the repair gets built right. And is that legally enforced? Is it? So like, what does solve mean? And so, you know, problem, criteria of solution, right? Weak criteria, problem is more expensive and people don't want to do it as much. Stronger criteria, problem is formally impossible. You know, or something like that, right? Problem is being procedurally solved as it goes. So making it more expensive is the first one. Having that money be allocated to the technologies to clean it up in real time such that the commons has no net negative harm. How much money does that cost is the amount that it should be, right? Not just what the market will bear, but what it actually costs to clean the fucking thing up. Well, what if there isn't that much money, then you have to make it a little bit more expensive. Right, which is why you have to do the political economy thing because the incentive alone won't be enough because who's gonna, you might not be able to, like, you have that money but it can't clean it up so who cares.

51:04 - Unidentified Speaker
So if we could write, like, build catastrophe weapons in basements, problem.

51:09 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
And other forms of build terrorist cells and shit like that, so like, secret stuff worse with advanced tech. And then there's like, but outside of government, right, then there's like bad secret shit inside of governments where we actually want, where the concern that the opposite is classified information broke democracy. There's no fucking democracy when everything's a national security secret, nobody gets actually have the information to vote on any fucking thing. That's a different problem, right? These are both problems. Externalities a problem. Um uh sensors creating dystopian potentials are if if we can make the list of the problems that people have proposed maybe some crypto thing could be part of the solution of and then we could look at crypto thing compared to other solutions I think this would be very helpful or crypto thing as part of a solution along with other things. And we have to be able to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches. That's one project problem. Crypto is part of a solution compared to other solutions. The second approach is crypto can do zero knowledge proof. Crypto can do uncorruptible ledgers. Crypto can do decentralized consensus on certain kinds of information that can compile and compute. Each of these offers this series of affordances. These are bad things that people could do with it. These are good things people could do with it. Those are the two lists that I think I really want. One of the problems with this space that I think has been mind-numbing for me is the claim, the squishiness, right? Like claim could do this kind of thing, but not, is it better than other ways of doing it? Is the problem rightly defined? And so I want to get clear exactly what problem are we solving? How important is that problem? Are we rightly defining it? And is this the best way of solving that problem?

53:30 - Benjamin Life
Does this make sense? Yeah. And I kind of have my own list, which is mostly based off of your work, Daniel, in terms of describing the generator functions that you would most like us to look at.

53:50 - Benjamin Life
Would you mind running through that list?

53:53 - Benjamin Life
Generator functions? And or problem statements that might be connected to multiple generator functions. Like misaligned incentives, corporate capture of democratic institutions, centralization of wealth through the corporate form, those kinds of things. I think you're just asking what's the priority list to work through.

54:14 - Kevin Owocki
Is that right, Benjamin?

54:16 - Benjamin Life
Yeah, just so that I can go knock out the things that would be most valuable to you, Daniel, in that report.

54:26 - Unidentified Speaker
Do you know Chris Eddy?

54:29 - Kevin Owocki
Yeah, we did an intro to him a bit ago.

54:34 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Reach out to Chris and ask him to share with you, and it'll have to be private, this is not shareable yet, the Metacrisis manifesto work, because it is flushed out in a lot of detail there. Um, let me tell you, let me just check what time it is. Okay. Um, I think we've got 10 more minutes.

55:06 - Kevin Owocki
If we were going to go for an hour from 1120 to 1220. So do we want to call it 10 more minutes?

55:17 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Yeah. Okay. I think one thing that would help me because I actually am intimate with the technology is the other direction, which you guys could come back with, which is, okay, this was a novel technology, right? And it allowed Bitcoin, and it had to do with this proof of work thing. And here's how that worked. And here's what people hope could happen from it. And here's what has or hasn't, right. But if we can, obviously, there's different ways of creating zero knowledge understand different ways of breaking them, which you'll always have an arms race on cryptographic type things. And you're talking about methods of solving Oracle problems and being able to get consensus regarding sensor data or attestation data. If you could say the fundamental technological innovations are these things, and here's what it seems the affordances of these things are, me, I'd be able to think better. And so if you could just kind of walk me through that, walk me through slow enough that I understand the causal mechanisms of the tech. Because then I can also understand how is quantum likely or not likely to break it. And things like that, how are increasingly good LLMs pretending to be a, I mean, pretending to be humans acting as bots likely or unlikely to break it, that kind of thing. Um, so I can provide stuff and I'm saying, get it from Chris in terms of problems. You already have a chunk. If you can provide me in terms of affordances, I think that'd be very helpful. And then I think one of the things we could do that would probably be the most valuable if you guys want to take and run with it, I'm happy to make a call for this. I, I have the, outline most of what would make a viable alternative to a political economy, technologically, the tech stack that would allow us to be able to do digital democracy for the US. I've talked with Aubrey Tang a lot about why the Taiwanese system wouldn't work here and what it doesn't even do in Taiwan, but what does work about it. I've talked with a lot of the folk about it. I've never written this up. Parts of it do involve cryptographic solutions, parts of it involve other stuff, and parts of it that are at a high enough level of abstraction that exactly what tech mediates, it's not clear yet, but it's must have these capabilities and have this sequence of operations and stuff. We could do one where I describe all of that, you guys record it and then work on writing it up and then start poking holes in it and also start finding tech that would facilitate the parts of it.

58:10 - Unidentified Speaker
This would be incredibly valuable.

58:12 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

58:15 - Kevin Owocki
Um, that sounds good to me. I'd love to, to shift into like an administrative mode and like project management. I can just kind of share the doc that I've been working on during this call, if that's all right with y'all, but I would propose that we, that we do organization and planning for the remainder of the call, unless there's anything else to get out from your side, Daniel.

58:35 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
One more thing about agenda I want to offer. So basically in the beginning, we talked about the agenda of offering to the crypto for good world and assessment of the crypto for good claims, which is different than either of the two things I just mentioned, right? I mentioned legitimate problems we want to solve and affordances of the tech. But the crypto for good claims so far were all squishy. So I'm saying we probably can't solve the squishiness without doing that other thing. But the offer to the space is that here were the list of squishy claims. Let's actually formalize them. In order to do this, here's what it would have to do. These ones are bunk. These ones are actually interesting. These ones could be interesting with future tech. These ones are interesting now, that kind of thing. That's the offering to the crypto space, I think. The offering to the world for us of, are there affordances of the tech where there are claims that nobody's thought of, but that would be fucking rad that we should think through together? That's interesting. Problems to solve crypto as one part of a whole solution suite. They can do it, but not staying crypto focused anymore. And then obviously that converging up to PEC that would facilitate political economy. Now, I want to offer another frame. The other frame is one that I think a lot of people are very sympathetic to right now. I think Benjamin probably relates to some of the other work is the when the Constitution was made, obviously, there weren't computers. We already had to update a lot of shit to have computers, there have been updates, because 1776 had a different world, right. And, but How would we carry out the spirit of the law in the Constitution if built from scratch with Fourth Industrial Revolution tech? How does the social structure get strengthened rather than fucked in the presence of Fourth Industrial Revolution tech? Well, here's all the ways Fourth Industrial Revolution tech can and are fucking it, right? Here's ways they could actually bolster it, and here's what the spirit of the law distinct the way the letter of the law implemented it with 1776 technology, right? So the first part is, here's what it said. Here's what the spirit of the law here is, that is relevant in 2026, not 1776, still the core thing that we're trying to achieve here. Here's how it's being in fact, here's how it could be upgraded. And so this is a updating social structure in service of the superstructure that is actually cared about factoring the new infrastructure. That's, I think, the critical thing we want to be doing. So these are just a few different high-level frames for how to talk about the work in this.

1:01:48 - Benjamin Life
Great.

1:01:49 - Benjamin Life
I'm seeing two main deliverables here, one being that political economy outline that I would love to work with you on and what however you want to info dump all of that I would love to be honored to support with that and similarly um restructuring what we had been working on to focus on specific problem statements uh with kind of red team blue team around the how the technology does or does not address or would make it worse the affordances the core primitives of web three. And then lastly, evaluating some of the broader claims within the impact web three space and evaluating their veracity. And then I would say maybe the third thing, once those two documents are delivered, doing some kind of round table with the two of you and Audrey and Vitalik and maybe Michelle balance. I mean, there there's some other folks that are relevant here in terms of what that new social contract is. And I think there, I've been sort of banging my head against the wall on this for a really long time around making those same kind of parallels to 1776, and you know Christopher, life also loves to do that. And I feel like with the intellectual firepower of that group of people, I think we could really make a splash in terms of articulating the contours of that emerging social contract as sort global effort, that would be sort of my highest aspirational outcome for this process. Yep, I think we're aligned on all that.

1:03:29 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
That's a lot of shit, right? That's a lot.

1:03:32 - Benjamin Life
Yeah, a lot of shit.

1:03:33 - Kevin Owocki
I guess like a point of question for me as like the capital allocator and like a person who's like organizing timelines and money that I'm putting against this is that what is the foreign factor that we want the crypto scope and the political economy stuff to be delivered in? Because I think that We're all pretty good at thinking on our feet and delivering a podcast. But I also think that a paper has a little bit more gravitas and importance. And I just want to check around what form we see each of those deliverables coming to. And that affects the timeline upon which we could get it out, I think.

1:04:10 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
The thing that Benjamin said of, he said two, but it was three separate things. One was putting putting into some form factor, some stuff that I would share about key elements of a political economy, I think the first thing that that would get turned into is basically a, it's somewhere between an overview and specification doc of a system, right? So depending upon the degree of detail we went into, it would would be like between, it'd be a three-page executive summary with 25 pages of explanation, but the full specification of the underlying tech in which it would happen would be obviously a lot fuck more, but this would be at the process level. Okay, so these are the outcomes, these are the processes. That's that. As far as the other docs that looked at problems and solves, affordances, Right. So, like, social coordination problems. The next is web three technologies and affordances, and then potentials. Right. Potentials based on what we've learned so far. Right. So, like, social coordination problems. The next is web three technologies and affordances, and then potentials. Based on those affordances. Third being claims of good things crypto can do and veracity assessment on those claims. And I would particularly take, with regard to the claims, obviously you've got the people who are focused on why provenance on metals not coming from conflict zones was going to be able to happen and why open science would get good based on and stuff and why Hillary couldn't fuck the emails up and why you know blah blah all the various those types of things but also why you could do public goods this way and some of the things Vitalik said I would love to just list all the claims and then categorize them right because you're gonna have some that are some that are about anti-corruption, some that are about increased privacies and freedoms, but some that are the opposite, they're about increased accountability, which is kind of anti-corruption thing. But like there'll be some way of chunking them that makes sense. But then I really like to do the kind of veracity checking on, yes, this could kind of do this, way of doing something you can do just as well with fucking dollars or normal ledgers. This is stupid. Or no, this actually is way better for these reasons. And then I would fucking love, if that gets kind of tight, to get the Vitalics and the other thought leaders in the space, the Maddies and everybody to look at it and be like, no, no, you guys got this wrong. And to start to be like, yeah, this is actually a pretty clear assessment. I'm mentioning the problems and the affordances, because it's upstream of how we think about it. But the claims is the thing we talked about first. But yes, ideally, we would do all those together. Because I think to be able to, the claims, it can do this, is an implicit problem with an implicit affordance, which is why it's squishy. And I want to make those implicit things explicit enough that we can actually be like, yes, this is real and makes sense.

1:07:58 - Kevin Owocki
Just to time check, I know that Can we do like three or four more minutes as we wrap up?

1:08:05 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

1:08:05 - Kevin Owocki
Daniel, I guess I just want to name something that's in the back of my mind as we discuss this scope, and that's that you're such a high resolution thinker. And one of the things that I think has been challenging for me is that podcasts and papers are sort of like a one dimensional serialized way of getting information out. And as a result, the information isn't represented in its complexity or trend like I guess what I'm getting for here is like has anyone tried to take a graph make a graph database of all of your interconnected thoughts and how they relate to each other and it's because I think that having that topology mapped we can be working right now on being able to create a knowledge management system that is n-dimensional where you can put all of the metadata associated of ways to data visit.

1:08:57 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So you can take a nodal network and then be able to click on any relationship between them and have it become its own node and shit like that. We're not there yet. It's totally needed because obviously collapsing an n dimensional space into 2d sucks shit, right? Like it's valuable, but you have to be able to do lots of different 2d slices to get a good sense. So already here, the one document where we just said problems, affordances, claims, those are three lenses on the same goddamn space, but you need the three lenses, right? So what I would say is, I generally like to start, if I can, with just an outline, just a structured fucking taxonomy. And I'm clear that either this is a single taxonomy, or it's a formal taxonomy. I try to, can I, if I can make, sometimes the formal ones could be made lots of different ways. And I have to acknowledge why I'm picking this way versus this way. Formal taxonomy means necessary and sufficient. But if I'm saying for this thing, I'm doing a formal taxonomy this way, necessary and sufficient, it's the max info compression on the space. So what I would say is, If you guys, you know, want to innovate with this, fuck yeah, that's great. But let's just, let's, if, if we can even start that can, so when, when we start to describe some of the stuff we'll describe about how to get voting systems, right. And how to get proposition crafting, right. And stuff like that and how to get surveillance, right. It'll be a level of detail I've never talked about on podcasts because there's no talk about it on podcast. So it'll be much more detail. But then in getting to write it down and getting to refine it, it will, there will be more than one linear way of doing it. And you will have to get a couple of those. But it's not that hard. Like we, we do this when we write policy docs and stuff. And so I am happy that you're thinking about it. And I do think the that there is a long term thing that needs to happen. But I think the next steps are tractable. OK. That makes sense.

1:11:16 - Kevin Owocki
Last question for me is just what can you commit to in terms of ongoing support for this work? Would you be able to meet with us for an hour every other week until we get something together? And then we'll obviously rely on Chris as sort of like for doing the legwork. You know, I think like what kind of ongoing support and can you offer and what does your schedule look like for the for the next month or two?

1:11:51 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Yep This will take much more than a month or two if we're gonna actually really Dial some of those things in fully but tell me we can get quicker.

1:12:02 - Kevin Owocki
Let me look at my calendar and Kevin I'll send you a follow-up message and we'll work on timelines Yes I was just going to say, and we'll rely on Chris and your organization as much as we can, because I know that your schedule is tough.

1:12:19 - Benjamin Life
Go ahead, Benjamin. There's sort of the intrinsic value of doing this, and then there's also the extrinsic value of the relationship building part of it. And I think for myself, and I think for Kevin and Allo and Gitcoin, there's a tremendous and to working together in ways that align ourselves with CRI as a kind of force multiplier of our work. And so I'd also be curious if there's formal partnership potential in any of these areas that we can use to extend the work beyond just something that we're doing on the side here.

1:12:59 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Yes, I'm already thinking about that as I'm thinking about the tech plex we're building and you guys working on technology and ways of maybe coming in a little tighter there. Also, I don't know about the OpenCivics work of related to some of the work that we're doing and, you know, redundancy should be removed. So let's dive into that. One thing about GitHub and Allo would be like, I don't know how many other people you have who can do research I remember Steven Read was around before. I don't know who, I don't know who has technical skills, like who can do data viz, who can do under, who can do prototyping and programming, who can do research well, who can write well. And, um, like who understands political economy and law well, like, because I know what's in my team, but like knowing some of the resources you guys have to work with. And if you don't have them yet capital, you would have, if we were going to bring some people in that would be worth knowing because I would think about this differently based on what we have to work with.

1:14:09 - Kevin Owocki
I think that of the people that I'm loosely calling Metacrisis DAO from 2022, R.I.P. For Metacrisis DAO, I think that we have on tap writers and researchers and data visualization experts, pretty much whatever you need. To build some momentum here I think that we can add some I think the real question becomes uh when we start to get to a level of engagement where they need compensation where does that money come from um that's that's the real rub um but but just know that over time we have a deep access and a deep bench that we could draw on as we develop momentum and then as far as the what is the 3.0 or whatever of get coin community have you written that up yet.

1:14:58 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
I mean, I know it's being refined and obviously it could be on this thing of, of the entire crypto for good space. These are the really valid things and what we're doing moving forward. This, which is what I'm hoping it's going to be, but I haven't heard from you yet on that. Yeah, sure.

1:15:14 - Kevin Owocki
Um, if we could do two more minutes, I know I keep moving the goalposts, but I just want to be explicit about the time we're spending, uh, that I could, I could go into that. That's so good. Um, so basically Nuts and bolts, we've got $30 million left. Crypto market's been pumping, so our treasury has gone up a little bit. We are planning on running every six months a capital allocation event in Ethereum to solve Ethereum's biggest problems and to solve the world's biggest problems using Ethereum. Now, that's obviously a very subjective question, but it's important to me, Daniel, that you see Gitcoin as a line, not a dot, which is to say that in October, we're going to do Gitcoin Grants 24. And then in February of 2026, we're going to do Bitcoin Grants 26, and then we'll do 27. And so it's an iterative evolutionary experiment. Basically, what we're trying to do is maximize the use of those funds. $1.3 million we're deploying in October to solve the world's problems with Ethereum and Ethereum's biggest problems.

1:16:17 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Secondarily, we are trying to evolve the world's biggest can solve with Ethereum?

1:16:23 - Kevin Owocki
Do you have that list? Yeah. So basically, this is what it looks like, I'm just going to share my screen. So these are the proposals that we just got for Gitcoin Grants 24. And I'll just do them all the way in.

1:16:41 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
You guys didn't centrally say these are the big problems. People submitted things that they think fit that criteria.

1:16:50 - Kevin Owocki
Yeah, and like half of these are crap, but like there's a quarter of them that are really, I think like show a lot of potential, specifically like Ethereum localism and decentralized AI, people who are working on public goods funding mechanisms and research, making sure that they have money. Those are priorities for us. So like I can send these over like a summary of these to you if you want, but yeah, the point is that we're doing this bottoms up and it's engaging through a dialogue with the Gitcoin community and the Ethereum community.

1:17:21 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

1:17:22 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So in the funding, does the team vote on funding allocation or do you decide on funding allocation?

1:17:30 - Kevin Owocki
It's the GTC token holders of which I'm the only one left that hasn't dumped the token. So it's mostly me deciding, but through the legitimacy of my governance rights as founder and token holding. Understood.

1:17:47 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
So what you're going to do is you're going to look through those and not allocate anything to the shit ones. And to the good ones, you have to decide, is this a valid allocation? How much? And do I want to allocate as is, or do I want to allocate conditionally on them changing it a little bit? Okay. But then what you're going to try to do is based on that. So you're operating as a venture fund in that way. Um, or The reason I'm going to say venture fund is because most foundations are sloppy about their follow on rounds and venture funds aren't. So typically the venture fund does the seed round and it's only going, it actually wants pro rata rights for the A round if it goes well. And if it doesn't go well, there's no fucking A round, right? Or the seed round with different criteria or something, but there's like some clarity on went well versus didn't go well.

1:18:43 - Unidentified Speaker
Yep.

1:18:43 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Do you have that? Um, I'd call it vibe clarity.

1:18:47 - Kevin Owocki
Uh, we do retrospective reports after every round about what went right and what didn't go right. And it's, it's like, it's very much in a, like, you know, it's kind of like in a like grant bullshitty form, but like our goal is to bring that more on chain and cryptographically verifiable and to, to create more like, true clarity. And it also depends on the domain. Like open source funding is very different from Ethereum localism in how we measure and can legitimately track the impact.

1:19:19 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

1:19:20 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
Um, I want to get a video to you guys, uh, of a call that we recorded with one of the top business intelligence guys in the world on how to do effective planning and decision-making. There's a lot more, this is just the beginning of it, but incredibly helpful for like, what is the level of hypothesis clarity up front you should have? What is the level up front of assessment? Is the hypothesis correct or not? Do we continue to put resources or not? And how do we get learning cycles proper? Would you send that to them? Okay, great. Yeah. Okay, great.

1:20:01 - Kevin Owocki
Yeah, we'd love to review that and integrate that into how we're decision-making. I'd say that one of my big values is momentum and solving things incrementally over time. And I just want to tell you, Daniel, that we're going to fuck this up so many ways in Gitcoin Grants 24, but we'll suck less each individual time. And so as much as I can integrate your thinking up front in the start, that'll just make the trend line even better.

1:20:27 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
The other thing I would like is that There is a, there is a section on the problems of the world that is written that you guys can Read from Chris. There is a, it's really worth reading. There is a section on the generative dynamics. It's a lot more detailed than anything you've heard. And then what the third attractor generative dynamics are that are actually better in presentation form. I will ask Chris to put in the time and give that to you guys. Anyone else that's seriously in your team, bring them in.

1:21:01 - Unidentified Speaker
And I think it will be really helpful.

1:21:03 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
And then we'll talk about it afterwards. Okay. That sounds great.

1:21:07 - Kevin Owocki
Um, well, it seems like we've got plenty of action items for this call. Um, just to briefly recap, uh, Benjamin and I are going to work on the scope for the two documents that we're going to work on. We're going to follow up with Chris, uh, to record something for first. Yeah. Yeah, I'll compile a list of action items and put it in the signal chat. And maybe worth bringing Chris into the signal chat, the most recent group that we have. Great. And let's bring Tali in, who's my chief of staff.

1:21:38 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
We'll make sure that it happens on my side. Great. Well, thank you for the time, Daniel.

1:21:44 - Kevin Owocki
We're looking forward to engaging with you here.

1:21:46 - Kevin Owocki
I've been looking forward to actually being able to do it properly for a long time.

1:21:51 - Daniel Schmachtenberger
And now I think we're going to bring and the right people to help make sure it'll follow up.

1:21:57 - Kevin Owocki
I think that's been mostly on my side, so looking forward. Thank you for your time.
