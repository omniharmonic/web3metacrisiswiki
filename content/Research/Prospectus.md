## **An Assessment of the "Crypto for Good" Space**

This project is designed as a definitive, critical assessment of the entire "crypto for good" landscape. Its primary purpose is to filter the signal from the noise, providing a clear guide for builders, investors, and foundations.

### **Objective & Intended Impact**

* **Core Goal:** To systematically evaluate all claims about Web3 technology's potential for positive impact, categorizing them to direct effort and capital effectively.  
* **Desired Outcome:** To create a landmark document that brings clarity to the space, establishing a "before and after" moment. The aim is to stop the waste of time and resources on "confused or lying" projects and focus the community on legitimate, high-leverage use cases.  
* **Audience:** The primary audience is the crypto/Web3 community, particularly those in the "crypto for good" sector. It is also intended for foundations, investors, and partners considering involvement in these technologies.  
* **Authorship:** The document would be presented as an offering from the Gitcoin community, with advisory sign-off from key thinkers including Daniel Schmachtenberger, Vitalik Buterin, Audrey Tang, Glenn Weil, and Tristan Harris to lend it gravitas.

### **Proposed Structure & Methodology**

Schmachtenberger emphasizes the need for a rigorous, multi-lensed approach to avoid ambiguity. He proposes three potential frames for the essay:

Frame 1: Problem-Centric

This approach starts with a well-defined problem and evaluates Web3 as a potential solution.

1. **Define the Problem:** Clearly articulate a specific problem (e.g., pricing negative externalities, preventing the spread of disinformation).  
2. **Define Criteria for a Solution:** What would a successful solution look like?  
3. **Propose the Crypto-Based Solution:** Detail how a specific Web3 technology or mechanism could address the problem.  
4. **Analyze Alternate Solutions:** Compare the crypto approach to non-crypto alternatives (e.g., using the court system, traditional regulation).  
5. **Critique the Proposal:** Rigorously analyze the downsides of the crypto solution. How could it be gamed? What new problems might it create?

Frame 2: Technology-Centric (Affordance-Based)

This structure begins with a core technological primitive and explores its potential outcomes.

1. **Identify the Technology:** Start with a fundamental Web3 innovation (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs, uncorruptible distributed ledgers, decentralized consensus).  
2. **Define its Affordances:** What unique capabilities does this technology enable?  
3. **Map Potentials:**  
   * List the beneficial things that could be built using these affordances.  
   * List the detrimental things that could be built using these affordances.

Frame 3: Claim-Centric (Veracity Assessment)

This is the most direct approach to the project's goal of assessing the existing landscape.

1. **List All Claims:** Compile an exhaustive list of existing "crypto for good" claims (e.g., solving public goods funding, ensuring provenance for conflict-free minerals).  
2. **Formalize the Claims:** Deconstruct each "squishy" claim to make its implicit assumptions explicit (i.e., "What problem is it claiming to solve, and via what technological affordance?").  
3. **Categorize the Claims:** Group the claims by type (e.g., anti-corruption, privacy enhancement, democratic participation).  
4. **Conduct a Veracity Check:** Assess each claim's legitimacy, sorting them into categories:  
   * **Bunk:** The claim is unfounded or nonsensical.  
   * **Inefficient:** The claim is valid, but the problem can be solved just as well or better with simpler, non-crypto technology.  
   * **Legitimate:** The technology offers a uniquely powerful and superior solution to the problem.
