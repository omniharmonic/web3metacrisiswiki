# Panopticon

## Definition

**Panopticon** refers to a system of surveillance and control where individuals are constantly monitored and observed, creating a sense of being watched at all times, leading to self-regulation, conformity, and the internalization of surveillance, often with significant implications for privacy, autonomy, and democratic participation.

## Core Concepts

- **Constant Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring and observation of individuals
- **Self-Regulation**: Individuals regulating their own behavior due to surveillance
- **Conformity**: Pressure to conform to expected behaviors and norms
- **Internalization**: Internalizing surveillance and control mechanisms
- **Privacy Violation**: Massive invasion of personal privacy
- **Autonomy Erosion**: Undermining individual autonomy and free will

## Technical Mechanisms
