# Conviction Voting

## Definition

**Conviction Voting** is a governance mechanism that introduces the dimension of time into the voting process. In conviction voting, a member's voting power on a specific proposal increases the longer they "stake" or lock their tokens in support of it, with proposals passing once they accumulate sufficient "conviction" over time.

## Core Properties

### Time-Based Voting Power
- **Conviction accumulation**: Voting power increases over time as tokens are staked
- **Persistent support**: Long-term support is rewarded over short-term mobilization
- **Time dimension**: Time becomes a crucial factor in governance decisions
- **Gradual influence**: Influence builds gradually rather than instantaneously
- **Commitment rewards**: Rewards for long-term commitment to proposals

### Anti-Manipulation Design
- **Flash loan resistance**: Cannot acquire influence instantaneously
- **Long-term thinking**: Encourages long-term thinking about proposals
- **Commitment mechanism**: Requires commitment to proposals over time
- **Gradual influence**: Prevents sudden changes in voting power
- **Stability**: Creates more stable governance outcomes

## Beneficial Potentials

### Governance Innovation
- **Long-term thinking**: Encourages long-term thinking about governance
- **Commitment rewards**: Rewards for long-term commitment to proposals
- **Stability**: Creates more stable governance outcomes
- **Anti-manipulation**: Resistant to short-term manipulation
- **Community building**: Builds community around long-term proposals

### Public Goods Funding
- **Persistent funding**: Better funding for projects that need long-term support
- **Community commitment**: Builds community commitment to projects
- **Sustainable funding**: Creates sustainable funding mechanisms
- **Long-term projects**: Better support for long-term projects
- **Innovation**: Encourages innovation in funding mechanisms

### Economic Efficiency
- **Optimal allocation**: Resources allocated based on long-term preferences
- **Welfare maximization**: Maximizes aggregate welfare over time
- **Efficient outcomes**: Better outcomes than short-term voting
- **Preference revelation**: Reveals true long-term preferences
- **Market-like mechanisms**: Combines democratic decision-making with market efficiency

## Detrimental Potentials

### Technical and Implementation Challenges
- **Complexity**: More complex than traditional voting systems
- **User experience**: Difficult for non-technical users to understand
- **Implementation costs**: Higher costs for implementation and maintenance
- **Vote counting**: More complex vote counting and verification
- **System design**: Requires careful design of conviction mechanisms

### Security and Manipulation Risks
- **Sybil attacks**: Creating multiple identities to gain more conviction
- **Collusion**: Coordinated staking to manipulate outcomes
- **Gaming**: Strategic staking to maximize personal benefit
- **Identity verification**: Need for robust identity systems
- **Stake buying**: Potential for buying and selling stakes

### Economic and Social Challenges
- **Inequality**: May still favor those with more resources
- **Complexity**: May exclude less educated participants
- **Adoption barriers**: High barriers to adoption in existing systems
- **Cultural resistance**: Resistance to new voting mechanisms
- **Education requirements**: Need for voter education and training

## Technical Implementation

### Conviction Calculation
```
Conviction = Staked Amount Ã— Time Staked
Threshold = Required Conviction for Proposal to Pass
```

### Key Components
- **Staking mechanism**: Tokens staked in support of proposals
- **Time tracking**: Time since staking begins
- **Conviction calculation**: Conviction calculated from stake and time
- **Threshold setting**: Threshold for proposal passage
- **Unstaking mechanism**: Mechanism for unstaking tokens
