# Provenance

## Definition

**Provenance** refers to the ability to track and verify the origin, history, and authenticity of data, assets, or information throughout its lifecycle, enabling transparency, accountability, and trust in digital systems and transactions.

## Core Concepts

- **Origin Tracking**: Tracking the origin and source of data or assets
- **History Verification**: Verifying the complete history of data or assets
- **Authenticity**: Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of data or assets
- **Transparency**: Providing transparency in data and asset flows
- **Accountability**: Enabling accountability for data and asset handling
- **Trust**: Building trust through verifiable provenance

## Technical Mechanisms

### Blockchain and Distributed Ledger
