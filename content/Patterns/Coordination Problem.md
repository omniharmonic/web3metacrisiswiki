# Coordination Problem

## Definition

A **Coordination Problem** occurs when multiple parties need to align their actions to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, but lack clear mechanisms for coordination. Unlike the [[Free Rider Problem]] where individuals have incentives to defect, coordination problems arise when all parties want to cooperate but face challenges in aligning their choices. These problems are particularly relevant to technology adoption, standard setting, and network effects in Web3 systems.

## Core Dynamics

### Alignment Challenges
- **Multiple equilibria**: Multiple possible stable outcomes
- **Coordination failure**: Parties choosing incompatible strategies
- **Information problems**: Lack of knowledge about others' intentions
- **Timing issues**: Need for simultaneous or sequential coordination

### Key Characteristics
- **Mutual benefit**: All parties benefit from successful coordination
- **Strategic interdependence**: Individual outcomes depend on others' choices
- **Multiple solutions**: Often several possible coordination outcomes
- **Path dependence**: Early choices constraining future options

## Types of Coordination Problems
