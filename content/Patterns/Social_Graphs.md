# Social Graphs

## Definition

**Social Graphs** in Web3 represent user-owned, portable social connections and relationships that are stored on decentralized networks. Unlike traditional social media platforms where users' social connections are controlled by centralized platforms, Web3 social graphs give users complete ownership and control over their social data.

## Core Properties

### User Ownership and Control
- **Data sovereignty**: Users own their social connections
- **Portability**: Social graphs can be moved between platforms
- **Control**: Users control who can access their social data
- **Privacy**: Users control what information is shared
- **Censorship resistance**: Difficult to censor or control

### Key Mechanisms
- **Decentralized storage**: Social data stored on decentralized networks
- **Cryptographic verification**: Cryptographically verified connections
- **Selective sharing**: Users control what information to share
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Working across different platforms
- **Economic incentives**: Rewards for maintaining social graphs

## Beneficial Potentials

### Economic and Social Challenges
- **Economic incentives**: Lack of economic incentives for adoption
- **Network effects**: Need for widespread adoption
- **Social acceptance**: Resistance to new social systems
- **Digital divide**: Excluding users without technical knowledge
- **Content moderation**: Difficult to moderate content in decentralized systems
