## Definition

**Quadratic Voting** is a voting mechanism that allows voters to express the intensity of their preferences by allocating multiple votes to issues they care about most, with the cost per vote increasing quadratically. This system enables more nuanced preference expression while protecting minority interests from majority tyranny.

## Core Properties

### Preference Intensity Expression
- **Multiple votes**: Voters can allocate multiple votes to express preference intensity
- **Quadratic cost**: Cost per vote increases quadratically (1 vote = 1 credit, 2 votes = 4 credits, 3 votes = 9 credits)
- **Budget constraints**: Voters have limited voting credits to allocate
- **Preference ranking**: Natural ranking of issues by importance to each voter

### Anti-Plutocratic Design
- **Diminishing returns**: Wealthy voters cannot dominate through sheer financial power
- **Minority protection**: Small groups can concentrate votes on issues they care about
- **Democratic equality**: Each voter gets the same initial voting budget
- **Preference intensity**: Captures how much voters care about different issues

## Beneficial Potentials

### Democratic Innovation
- **Preference intensity**: Captures how much voters care about different issues
- **Minority protection**: Prevents majority tyranny on issues minorities care deeply about
- **Democratic equality**: Each voter gets equal initial voting power
- **Nuanced decision-making**: More sophisticated than simple majority rule
- **Consensus building**: Encourages compromise and coalition building

### Governance Applications
- **DAO governance**: Enhanced decision-making in decentralized organizations
- **Public goods funding**: Better allocation of resources to public goods
- **Policy decisions**: More nuanced policy choices in democratic systems
- **Resource allocation**: Fair distribution of limited resources
- **Conflict resolution**: Better resolution of disputes with multiple stakeholders

### Economic Efficiency
- **Optimal resource allocation**: Resources allocated based on true preferences
- **Welfare maximization**: Maximizes aggregate welfare of participants
- **Efficient outcomes**: Better outcomes than simple majority voting
- **Preference revelation**: Reveals true preferences of participants
- **Market-like mechanisms**: Combines voting with market-like efficiency

## Detrimental Potentials

### Technical and Implementation Challenges
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple voting systems
- **User experience**: Difficult for non-technical users to understand
- **Implementation costs**: Higher costs for implementation and maintenance
- **Vote counting**: More complex vote counting and verification
- **System design**: Requires careful design of voting budgets and constraints

### Security and Manipulation Risks
- **Sybil attacks**: Creating multiple identities to gain more voting power
- **Collusion**: Coordinated voting to manipulate outcomes
- **Gaming**: Strategic voting to maximize personal benefit
- **Identity verification**: Need for robust identity systems
- **Vote buying**: Potential for vote buying and selling

### Economic and Social Challenges
- **Inequality**: May still favor those with more resources
- **Complexity**: May exclude less educated participants
- **Adoption barriers**: High barriers to adoption in existing systems
- **Cultural resistance**: Resistance to new voting mechanisms
- **Education requirements**: Need for voter education and training

## Technical Implementation

### Voting Mechanism
```
Votes = √(Credits Spent)
Cost = (Votes)²
```

### Key Components
- **Voting credits**: Initial allocation of voting credits to each voter
- **Quadratic pricing**: Cost increases quadratically with number of votes
- **Budget constraints**: Total credits available to each voter
- **Vote allocation**: Voters allocate votes across multiple issues
- **Outcome determination**: Issues with most votes win

## Use Cases and Applications

### Public Goods Funding
- **Quadratic funding**: Anti-plutocratic funding mechanisms
- **Public goods**: Better funding of public goods
- **Community projects**: Fair allocation of community resources
- **Research funding**: Better allocation of research resources
- **Infrastructure funding**: Fair funding of infrastructure projects

### Democratic Systems
- **Policy decisions**: More nuanced policy choices
- **Resource allocation**: Fair distribution of limited resources
- **Budget decisions**: Better budget allocation
- **Constitutional changes**: More careful constitutional changes
- **Election systems**: Enhanced election systems
