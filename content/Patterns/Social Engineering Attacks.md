# Social Engineering Attacks

## Definition

**Social Engineering Attacks** refer to psychological manipulation techniques used to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information, performing actions, or making decisions that compromise their security, often by exploiting human psychology and trust rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## Core Concepts

- **Psychological Manipulation**: Exploiting human psychology and emotions
- **Trust Exploitation**: Abusing trust relationships and social connections
- **Information Gathering**: Collecting personal and sensitive information
- **Deception**: Using false pretenses to gain access or information
- **Authority Exploitation**: Impersonating authority figures or institutions

## Technical Mechanisms

### Attack Vectors
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails, messages, or websites
- **Pretexting**: Creating false scenarios to obtain information
- **Baiting**: Offering something attractive to entice victims
- **Tailgating**: Following authorized personnel into restricted areas
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else to gain trust

### Information Gathering
- **OSINT**: Open source intelligence gathering
- **Social Media**: Exploiting information shared on social platforms
- **Public Records**: Using publicly available information
- **Data Breaches**: Leveraging information from previous breaches
- **Social Networks**: Exploiting connections and relationships

## Beneficial Potentials
