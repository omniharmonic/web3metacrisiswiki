# Definition

Goodhart's Law is an adage stating, "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." This means that once a specific metric is used as a goal or target for control or performance evaluation, people tend to optimize or manipulate that measure in ways that undermine its original purpose or meaning. The law highlights the unintended consequences of relying too heavily on any single metric for decision-making or policy enforcement.

It was named after British economist Charles Goodhart, who articulated the concept in a 1975 article on monetary policy. The law warns that any observed statistical regularity used for control purposes tends to collapse because people or systems adapt to the incentives created by the measure becoming a target.

Goodhart's Law is commonly illustrated through examples such as a call center where employees, incentivized solely by the number of calls handled, sacrifice call quality, or historical cases like the "cobra effect," where a bounty on dead cobras led to people breeding more cobras to collect the reward.

There are also several variations and types of Goodhartâ€™s Law, including regressional, extremal, causal, and adversarial forms, which describe different ways that measurement and optimization breakdowns occur. These insights demonstrate how simplistic targets fail to capture complex realities and lead to distortions and gaming of the system.[wikipedia+4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law)
