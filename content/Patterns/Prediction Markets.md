## Definition

**Prediction Markets** are markets where participants trade contracts based on the outcomes of future events, with prices reflecting collective predictions about the likelihood of those outcomes. These markets aggregate dispersed information and incentivize accurate predictions through financial rewards, making them powerful tools for [[Information_Aggregation]], [[Futarchy]], and decision-making in Web3 governance systems.

## Core Mechanism

### Market Structure
- **Binary markets**: Yes/No outcomes for specific events
- **Multiple choice**: Multiple possible outcomes for events
- **Continuous markets**: Continuous probability distributions
- **Conditional markets**: Markets conditional on other events

### Trading Mechanisms
- **Market makers**: Providing liquidity and setting prices
- **Limit orders**: Participants setting specific prices for trades
- **Market orders**: Immediate execution at current market prices
- **Automated trading**: Algorithmic trading based on information

### Price Discovery
- **Information aggregation**: Prices reflect collective information
- **Incentive alignment**: Financial rewards for accurate predictions
- **Market efficiency**: Markets efficiently aggregate information
- **Wisdom of crowds**: Collective intelligence through market mechanisms

- **Verification**: Ensuring outcome data is accurate and reliable
- **Dispute resolution**: Handling disputes about outcome measurements
- **Transparency**: Making market information publicly available

### Governance Integration
- **Proposal process**: How events are proposed for prediction markets
- **Implementation authority**: Who implements market outcomes
- **Enforcement mechanisms**: Ensuring market outcomes are implemented
