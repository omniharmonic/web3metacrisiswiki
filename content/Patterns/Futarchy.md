# Futarchy

## Definition

**Futarchy** is a governance system proposed by economist Robin Hanson where decisions are made through [[Prediction Markets]] rather than traditional voting. In futarchy, participants bet on the outcomes of different policy options, and the policy with the highest predicted success (as determined by market prices) is implemented. This system aims to aggregate dispersed information and incentivize accurate predictions about policy outcomes.

## Core Mechanism

### Prediction Market Governance
- **Policy proposals**: Various policy options are proposed
- **Market betting**: Participants bet on the outcomes of different policies
- **Price signals**: Market prices reflect collective predictions about policy success
- **Implementation**: The policy with the highest predicted success is implemented
- **Outcome measurement**: Actual outcomes are measured and compared to predictions

### Information Aggregation
- **Dispersed knowledge**: Leveraging information held by many participants
- **Incentive alignment**: Financial incentives for accurate predictions
- **Market efficiency**: Markets efficiently aggregate information
- **Wisdom of crowds**: Collective intelligence through market mechanisms

### Decision Process
- **Proposal submission**: Anyone can propose policies
- **Market creation**: Prediction markets created for each policy
- **Trading period**: Participants trade on policy outcomes
- **Decision rule**: Policy with highest market price is implemented
- **Outcome verification**: Actual outcomes measured and compared

## Beneficial Applications

### Information Aggregation
- **Dispersed knowledge**: Leveraging information held by many participants
- **Expertise utilization**: Experts can profit from their knowledge
- **Market efficiency**: Markets efficiently aggregate information
- **Wisdom of crowds**: Collective intelligence through market mechanisms

### Incentive Alignment
- **Financial incentives**: Participants profit from accurate predictions
- **Loss aversion**: Participants lose money from inaccurate predictions
- **Expertise rewards**: Knowledgeable participants are rewarded
- **Accountability**: Predictors are held accountable for their predictions

### Decision Quality
- **Outcome focus**: Decisions based on predicted outcomes rather than preferences
- **Evidence-based**: Policies chosen based on evidence of effectiveness
- **Comparative analysis**: Direct comparison of policy alternatives
- **Continuous improvement**: Learning from prediction accuracy

### Web3 Applications
- **[[decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)]]**: Governance for decentralized organizations
- **Protocol governance**: Managing blockchain protocol decisions
- **Resource allocation**: Deciding how to allocate community resources
- **Policy implementation**: Implementing community policies

## Detrimental Potentials

### Market Manipulation
- **Price manipulation**: Sophisticated players manipulating market prices
- **Coordination attacks**: Organized manipulation of prediction markets
- **Information asymmetry**: Unequal access to relevant information
- **Market power**: Large players dominating prediction markets

### Measurement Challenges
- **Outcome definition**: Difficulty defining and measuring policy outcomes
- **Time horizons**: Long-term outcomes difficult to measure
- **Causal attribution**: Difficulty attributing outcomes to specific policies
- **External factors**: Outcomes affected by factors beyond policy control

### Participation Barriers
- **Financial requirements**: Need for capital to participate in markets
- **Expertise requirements**: Need for knowledge to make accurate predictions
- **Information costs**: Expensive to gather relevant information
- **Time requirements**: Need for time to analyze and trade

### Systemic Risks
- **Market failures**: Prediction markets can fail like other markets
- **Liquidity problems**: Insufficient trading volume for accurate prices
- **Speculation**: Markets driven by speculation rather than information
- **Bubble formation**: Irrational exuberance in prediction markets

## Implementation Challenges

### Market Design
- **Market creation**: Creating prediction markets for policy outcomes
- **Liquidity provision**: Ensuring sufficient trading volume
- **Price discovery**: Mechanisms for discovering accurate prices
- **Market resolution**: Determining final outcomes and payouts

### Outcome Measurement
- **Metric definition**: Defining measurable outcomes for policies
- **Data collection**: Gathering data on policy outcomes
- **Verification**: Ensuring outcome data is accurate and reliable
- **Dispute resolution**: Handling disputes about outcome measurements

### Governance Integration
- **Proposal process**: How policies are proposed and evaluated
- **Implementation authority**: Who implements chosen policies
- **Enforcement mechanisms**: Ensuring policy implementation
- **Accountability systems**: Holding implementers accountable

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Market platforms**: Technology for prediction markets
- **Data systems**: Systems for collecting and verifying outcomes
- **Integration**: Connecting prediction markets to governance systems
- **User interfaces**: Making systems accessible to participants

## Variations and Extensions

### Hybrid Systems
- **Voting + prediction markets**: Combining traditional voting with prediction markets
- **Delegation + prediction markets**: Delegates using prediction markets for decisions
- **Expert panels**: Expert panels using prediction markets for guidance
- **Public consultation**: Public input combined with prediction market decisions

### Advanced Features
- **Conditional markets**: Markets conditional on specific events
- **Portfolio markets**: Markets for portfolios of policies
- **Dynamic markets**: Markets that adjust based on new information
- **Cross-market analysis**: Comparing predictions across different markets

### Web3 Integration
- **Smart contracts**: Automated execution of prediction market outcomes
- **Token-based**: Using tokens for prediction market participation
- **Decentralized oracles**: External data for outcome verification
- **Cross-chain**: Multi-blockchain prediction market systems
