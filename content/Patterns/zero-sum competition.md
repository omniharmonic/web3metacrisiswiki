# Zero-Sum Competition

## Definition

**Zero-Sum Competition** refers to competitive situations where one participant's gain is exactly balanced by another participant's loss, creating a competitive dynamic where total gains equal total losses, often leading to destructive competition and suboptimal outcomes for all participants.

## Core Concepts

- **Competitive Dynamics**: Competitive interactions between participants
- **Resource Scarcity**: Limited resources leading to competition
- **Winner-Take-All**: Winner-take-all competitive outcomes
- **Destructive Competition**: Competition that destroys value
- **Suboptimal Outcomes**: Outcomes that are suboptimal for all participants
- **Cooperation Failure**: Failure of cooperative solutions
