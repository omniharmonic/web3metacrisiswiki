# Selective Disclosure

## Definition

**Selective Disclosure** refers to the ability to reveal only specific, relevant information about oneself or one's data while keeping other information private, enabling privacy-preserving interactions and verifiable claims without exposing unnecessary personal details.

## Core Concepts

- **Privacy Preservation**: Maintaining privacy while sharing necessary information
- **Verifiable Claims**: Cryptographically verifiable statements about attributes
- **Minimal Disclosure**: Sharing only the minimum required information
- **User Control**: User control over what information is disclosed
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Mathematical proofs of claims without revealing underlying data

## Technical Mechanisms

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- **zk-SNARKs**: Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge
- **zk-STARKs**: Zero-knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge
- **Bulletproofs**: Range proofs for confidential transactions
