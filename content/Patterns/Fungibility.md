# Fungibility

## Definition

**Fungibility** refers to the property of an asset or good where individual units are essentially interchangeable and indistinguishable from one another, meaning that any unit can be substituted for any other unit of the same type without affecting its value or utility.

## Core Concepts

- **Interchangeability**: Units are mutually substitutable
- **Indistinguishability**: No meaningful differences between units
- **Uniform Value**: All units have the same value
- **Standardization**: Consistent properties across all units
- **Liquidity**: Easy exchangeability in markets

## Technical Mechanisms

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20**: Fungible token standard for Ethereum
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens
- **BEP-20**: Binance Smart Chain fungible token standard
- **TRC-20**: TRON blockchain fungible token standard
- **Cross-Chain Standards**: Fungible tokens across multiple blockchains

### Smart Contract Implementation
- **Minting Functions**: Creating new fungible tokens
- **Burning Functions**: Destroying fungible tokens
- **Transfer Functions**: Moving tokens between accounts
- **Balance Tracking**: Maintaining account balances
- **Supply Management**: Controlling total token supply
