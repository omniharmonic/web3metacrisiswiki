# Predictive Policing

## Definition

**Predictive Policing** refers to the use of data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models to forecast criminal activity, identify potential offenders, and allocate law enforcement resources, often with significant implications for civil liberties, privacy, and social justice.

## Core Concepts

- **Data Analytics**: Analysis of historical crime data and patterns
- **Machine Learning**: AI-powered prediction of criminal activity
- **Risk Assessment**: Assessment of individual and community risk factors
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocation of law enforcement resources based on predictions
- **Privacy Violation**: Massive invasion of personal privacy
- **Discrimination**: Discriminatory targeting and profiling

## Technical Mechanisms
