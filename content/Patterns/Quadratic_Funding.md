# Quadratic Funding

## Definition

**Quadratic Funding** is a mechanism for funding public goods that uses quadratic voting principles to determine how to distribute matching funds. It provides a way to fund public goods that is more democratic and less susceptible to plutocratic control than traditional funding mechanisms.

## Core Properties

### Anti-Plutocratic Design
- **Quadratic matching**: Matching funds increase quadratically with number of contributors
- **Democratic allocation**: Funding determined by number of contributors, not total amount
- **Minority protection**: Small contributions from many people can outcompete large contributions from few
- **Community-driven**: Funding decisions made by the community, not wealthy individuals
- **Transparent processes**: Open and auditable funding decisions

### Key Mechanisms
- **Individual contributions**: People contribute to projects they care about
- **Matching funds**: Central pool of matching funds distributed based on contributions
- **Quadratic formula**: Matching amount = (sum of square roots of contributions)²
- **Transparent allocation**: All funding decisions are public and verifiable
- **Community governance**: Community controls the matching fund pool

## Beneficial Potentials

### Public Goods Funding
- **Underfunded projects**: Better funding for projects that benefit many people
- **Community priorities**: Funding reflects community priorities, not just wealthy interests
- **Innovation support**: Support for innovative projects that may not be profitable
- **Social impact**: Better funding for projects with high social impact
- **Long-term thinking**: Encourages long-term thinking about public goods

### Democratic Innovation
- **Democratic allocation**: Funding decisions made democratically
- **Minority voices**: Amplifies voices of minority communities
- **Community empowerment**: Empowers communities to fund their own priorities
- **Transparent processes**: Open and auditable funding decisions
- **Accountability**: Clear accountability for funding decisions

### Economic Efficiency
- **Optimal allocation**: Resources allocated based on true community preferences
- **Welfare maximization**: Maximizes aggregate welfare of the community
- **Efficient outcomes**: Better outcomes than traditional funding mechanisms
- **Preference revelation**: Reveals true preferences of the community
- **Market-like mechanisms**: Combines democratic decision-making with market efficiency

## Detrimental Potentials

### Technical and Implementation Challenges
- **Complexity**: More complex than traditional funding mechanisms
- **User experience**: Difficult for non-technical users to understand
- **Implementation costs**: Higher costs for implementation and maintenance
- **Vote counting**: More complex vote counting and verification
- **System design**: Requires careful design of funding mechanisms

### Security and Manipulation Risks
- **Sybil attacks**: Creating multiple identities to gain more funding
- **Collusion**: Coordinated contributions to manipulate outcomes
- **Gaming**: Strategic contributions to maximize personal benefit
- **Identity verification**: Need for robust identity systems
- **Contribution buying**: Potential for buying and selling contributions

### Economic and Social Challenges
- **Inequality**: May still favor those with more resources
- **Complexity**: May exclude less educated participants
- **Adoption barriers**: High barriers to adoption in existing systems
- **Cultural resistance**: Resistance to new funding mechanisms
- **Education requirements**: Need for contributor education and training

## Technical Implementation

### Funding Formula
```
Matching Amount = (√(Contribution 1) + √(Contribution 2) + ... + √(Contribution n))²
```

### Key Components
- **Individual contributions**: People contribute to projects they care about
- **Matching pool**: Central pool of matching funds
- **Quadratic calculation**: Matching amount calculated using quadratic formula
- **Transparent allocation**: All funding decisions are public
- **Community governance**: Community controls the matching fund pool
