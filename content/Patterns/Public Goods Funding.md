## Definition

**Public Goods Funding** refers to mechanisms and systems designed to finance goods and services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrousâ€”meaning they benefit everyone and one person's use doesn't diminish another's ability to use them. In the Web3 context, this encompasses innovative funding mechanisms that address the traditional underfunding of public goods through [[decentralization]], [[Transparency]], and community-driven approaches. This represents a key solution to the [[Free Rider Problem]] and [[Collective Action Problem]]s in the [[meta-crisis]].

## Core Characteristics

### Non-excludability and Non-rivalry
- **Open access**: Benefits available to all participants
- **Shared value**: Individual consumption doesn't reduce availability for others
- **Network effects**: Value increases with broader adoption and participation

### Traditional Funding Challenges
- **[[Free Rider Problem]]**: Individuals benefit without contributing
- **[[Collective Action Problem]]**: Difficulty coordinating contributions
- **Market failure**: Private markets systematically underfund public goods
- **[[misaligned incentives]]**: Economic structures rewarding cost externalization

## Web3 Funding Mechanisms

### [[Quadratic Funding]]
- **Anti-plutocratic**: Reduces influence of large donors
- **Democratic matching**: Community preferences determine funding allocation
- **Preference intensity**: Captures strength of community support

### [[Quadratic Voting]]
- **Voice credit allocation**: Budget-based preference expression
- **Quadratic cost**: Prevents vote buying and plutocracy
- **Intensity measurement**: Captures how much people care about outcomes

### [[Conviction Voting]]
- **Time-weighted**: Voting power increases with commitment duration
- **Persistent support**: Favors long-term community backing
- **Flash loan resistance**: Cannot be gamed with temporary capital

### Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)
- **Impact-based**: Rewards demonstrated positive outcomes
- **Reduced speculation**: Funding based on actual results
- **Incentive alignment**: Encourages genuine public benefit creation

## Beneficial Applications

### Open Source Software Development
- **Developer incentives**: Sustainable funding for maintainers
- **Infrastructure support**: Critical but invisible software components
- **Security auditing**: Community-funded code reviews and bug bounties

### Scientific Research
- **Open access**: Publicly funded research remains publicly accessible
- **Reproducibility**: Transparent funding and methodology
- **Global collaboration**: Cross-border research coordination

### Environmental Protection
- **Carbon sequestration**: Community-funded climate initiatives
- **Biodiversity conservation**: Ecosystem preservation projects
- **Renewable energy**: Distributed clean energy infrastructure

### Digital Infrastructure
- **Decentralized storage**: Community-funded data preservation
- **Privacy tools**: Surveillance-resistant communication systems
- **Educational resources**: Open educational materials and platforms

## Detrimental Potentials

### Governance Capture
- **Wealthy influence**: Large token holders dominating decisions
- **Coordination attacks**: Organized groups gaming funding mechanisms
- **Plutocratic drift**: Gradual concentration of decision-making power

### Gaming and Manipulation
- **Sybil attacks**: Multiple identities to increase voting power
- **Collusion**: Coordinated manipulation of funding outcomes
- **Preference falsification**: Strategic voting rather than honest preferences

### Sustainability Challenges
- **Funding volatility**: Dependence on volatile cryptocurrency markets
- **Participation fatigue**: Community burnout from constant governance
- **Technical complexity**: Barriers to meaningful participation

## Implementation Challenges

### Identity and Verification
- **Proof of humanity**: Distinguishing real humans from bots
- **Privacy preservation**: Maintaining anonymity while preventing gaming
- **Scalable verification**: Cost-effective identity systems

### Mechanism Design
- **Parameter tuning**: Optimizing funding formulas and thresholds
- **Attack resistance**: Preventing manipulation and gaming
- **User experience**: Making complex mechanisms accessible

### Legal and Regulatory
- **Compliance**: Navigating securities and fundraising regulations
- **Tax implications**: Treatment of tokens and funding distributions
- **Cross-border coordination**: International legal frameworks
