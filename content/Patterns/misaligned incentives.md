## Definition

**Misaligned incentives** describe a foundational flaw in our current socio-economic operating system, where individually rational, self-interested actions predictably aggregate into collectively irrational and destructive outcomes. This systemic misalignment arises because our dominant economic model is structured to reward behaviors that successfully "externalize" costs.

## Core Mechanism: Multi-Polar Traps

The primary mechanism through which misaligned incentives manifest is the **multi-polar trap** (also known as social trap or tragedy of the commons):

- Multiple competing actors, each aware of potential for collectively disastrous outcome
- Nonetheless compelled to continue pursuing destructive strategy
- Fear of being disadvantaged if they unilaterally stop
- Logic: "If I don't do it, someone else will, and I will be the loser"
- Creates "race to the bottom" that is exceptionally difficult to exit

## Examples of Multi-Polar Traps

### Social Media Attention Economy
- Each platform incentivized to design ever-more addictive algorithms
- Cannot afford to unilaterally create less engaging product
- Would lose market share to competitors
- Results in mental health and social cohesion harms

### Arms Races
- Nation-states compelled to continuously develop advanced weaponry
- Nation that chooses to disarm becomes vulnerable
- Ensures escalatory cycle continues

### Resource Depletion (Tragedy of the Commons)
- Each fisherman incentivized to maximize catch
- Voluntary restriction leaves more fish for others
- Leads to inevitable collapse of fishery

## Generator Function of Meta-Crisis

Misaligned incentives are the **"generator function"** for the entire suite of systemic crises:

### Economic Centralization
- Relentless incentive to maximize profit by externalizing costs
- Capital accumulates in entities most adept at extractive process
- Immense wealth deployed to ensure continuation of favorable regulatory environment

### Regulatory Capture
- Wealth generated by extractive activities used to capture regulatory agencies
- Direct cause of regulatory capture

### Disinformation via AI
- Business models emerge from incentive landscape
- Attention economy produces disinformation as byproduct
- Outrageous and false content is highly engaging

### Mass Surveillance
- Business model requires constant data collection
- Creates technological and social infrastructure for surveillance

## Flaw in "Social DNA"

The problem runs deeper than flawed policies - it's a fundamental property of our civilizational operating system:

### Rivalrous, Zero-Sum Worldview
- Primary selection pressure: maximization of financial profit
- Structurally blind to most forms of social and ecological value
- Prosocial behavior becomes maladaptive
- System selects *against* actors who prioritize collective well-being

### Cultural and Systemic Agreements
- Formalized in infrastructures, institutions, and incentives
- Function like "social DNA" providing instructions for social organism
- Current code written in language of rivalry and competition

## Solution Criteria

Based on [[Vitality, Resilience, Choice]] principles:

### Vitality (Prosocial by Default)
- **Prosocial incentives**: Design mechanisms that reward positive externalities
- **New markets**: Ecosystem regeneration, open-source development compensation
- **Reputation systems**: Track contributions to commons
- **Aligned self-interest**: Rational self-interest becomes intrinsically aligned with collective well-being

### Resilience (Anti-Rivalrous Coordination)
- **Aligned incentives**: Cooperation becomes dominant, most rational strategy
- **Commons governance**: Clear boundaries, participatory rule-making, graduated sanctions
- **Economic structures**: Worker-owned cooperatives, ecological health currencies
- **Hard-coded cooperation**: Regenerative principles in economic substrate

### Choice (Pluralistic Value Systems)
- **Economic pluralism**: Diverse economic systems reflecting different definitions of good life
- **Complementary currencies**: Time banks, mutual credit systems, gift economies
- **Value diversity**: Social, ecological, cultural, and spiritual values beyond financial
- **Sovereign agency**: Meaningful participation in value-creation
