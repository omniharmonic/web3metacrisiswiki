## Definition

**Game Theory** is the mathematical study of strategic decision-making in situations where the outcome for each participant depends on the actions of all participants. It provides a framework for analyzing how rational, self-interested individuals make decisions in competitive and cooperative situations, making it essential for understanding [[Mechanism Design]], [[Tokenomics]], and strategic interactions in Web3 systems. Game theory is fundamental to addressing [[Collective Action Problem]]s and [[misaligned incentives]] in the [[meta-crisis]].

## Core Concepts

### Strategic Interactions
- **Players**: Decision-makers in the game
- **Strategies**: Available actions for each player
- **Payoffs**: Outcomes for each combination of strategies
- **Information**: What players know about the game and others' actions

### Key Assumptions
- **Rationality**: Players choose strategies to maximize their payoffs
- **Common knowledge**: All players know the game structure and others' rationality
- **Strategic thinking**: Players consider others' likely responses
- **Equilibrium analysis**: Focus on stable outcomes where no player wants to change

## Fundamental Concepts

### [[Nash Equilibrium]]
- **Definition**: Strategy profile where no player can unilaterally improve their payoff
- **Stability**: No incentive for any player to deviate from their strategy
- **Existence**: Nash equilibria exist in most games
- **Multiple equilibria**: Games often have multiple Nash equilibria

### [[Prisoner's Dilemma]]
- **Classic example**: Two prisoners deciding whether to cooperate or defect
- **Individual rationality**: Defecting is dominant strategy for each player
- **Collective irrationality**: Both defecting leads to worse outcome than cooperation
- **Applications**: [[Free Rider Problem]], arms races, environmental protection
- **[[multi-polar traps]]**: Competitive dynamics leading to collective harm

### Dominant Strategies
- **Dominant strategy**: Best strategy regardless of others' actions
- **Dominant strategy equilibrium**: When all players have dominant strategies
- **Iterated dominance**: Eliminating dominated strategies to find equilibria
- **Weak dominance**: Strategy that is never worse and sometimes better

### Mixed Strategies
- **Randomization**: Players randomizing over pure strategies
- **Mixed strategy equilibrium**: Nash equilibrium involving randomization
- **Indifference**: Players indifferent between strategies in equilibrium
- **Applications**: Auctions, matching, and coordination games

## Types of Games

### Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative
- **Non-cooperative**: Players cannot make binding agreements
- **Cooperative**: Players can make enforceable agreements
- **Nash equilibrium**: Solution concept for non-cooperative games
- **Core**: Solution concept for cooperative games

### Simultaneous vs. Sequential
- **Simultaneous**: Players choose actions at the same time
- **Sequential**: Players choose actions in a specific order
- **Extensive form**: Tree representation of sequential games
- **Backward induction**: Solving sequential games from the end

### Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero-Sum
- **Zero-sum**: One player's gain is another's loss
- **Non-zero-sum**: Players can both gain or both lose
- **Pareto efficiency**: Outcomes where no player can be made better off
- **Social welfare**: Total payoff across all players

### Repeated Games
- **Finitely repeated**: Game played a known number of times
- **Infinitely repeated**: Game played indefinitely
- **Folk theorem**: Cooperation possible in infinitely repeated games
- **Trigger strategies**: Punishing defection in repeated games

## Applications in Web3

### [[Mechanism Design]]
- **Auction design**: Creating efficient auction mechanisms
- **Voting systems**: Designing fair and efficient voting mechanisms
- **Matching markets**: Pairing participants optimally
- **Public goods**: Designing mechanisms for public good provision

### [[Tokenomics]]
- **Incentive design**: Creating token-based incentive systems
- **Staking mechanisms**: Designing economic security systems
- **Governance**: Creating token-based governance mechanisms
- **Market design**: Designing token markets and exchanges

### Consensus Mechanisms
- **[[Proof of Stake (PoS)]]**: Economic incentives for honest behavior
- **[[Slashing]]**: Penalties for malicious behavior
- **Validator selection**: Choosing validators for block production
- **Fork choice**: Resolving conflicts in blockchain history

### [[Public Goods Funding]]
- **[[Quadratic Funding]]**: Anti-plutocratic funding mechanisms
- **[[Quadratic Voting]]**: Preference intensity expression
- **[[Conviction Voting]]**: Time-weighted decision making
- **[[Holographic Consensus]]**: Attention economy management

## Beneficial Applications

## Implementation Challenges

### Information Requirements
- **Complete information**: Need for full knowledge of game structure
- **Common knowledge**: All players knowing what others know
- **Rationality assumptions**: Players acting rationally
- **Strategic sophistication**: Players understanding strategic interactions

### Computational Complexity
