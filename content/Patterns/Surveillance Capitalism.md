# Surveillance Capitalism

## Definition

**Surveillance Capitalism** refers to an economic system in which companies collect, analyze, and monetize personal data and behavioral information from users, often without their knowledge or consent, creating a new form of capitalism based on surveillance and data extraction.

## Core Concepts

- **Data Extraction**: Systematic collection of personal and behavioral data
- **Surveillance**: Comprehensive surveillance and monitoring of users
- **Monetization**: Converting user data into economic value
- **Privacy Violation**: Massive invasion of personal privacy
- **Autonomy Erosion**: Undermining individual autonomy and free will
- **Economic Exploitation**: Exploiting users for economic gain

## Technical Mechanisms

### Data Collection Systems
- **Web Tracking**: Cookies, pixels, and tracking scripts
- **Mobile Analytics**: App usage tracking and behavioral data
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Social media behavior analysis
- **Location Tracking**: GPS and location-based data collection
- **Biometric Data**: Physiological and behavioral biometrics
- **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Tracking across multiple platforms

### Data Processing and Monetization
