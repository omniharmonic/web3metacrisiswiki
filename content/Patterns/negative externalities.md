# Negative Externalities

## Definition

**Negative Externalities** refer to the unintended negative consequences and spillover effects of actions, decisions, and behaviors that impose costs on third parties not directly involved in the original action, often leading to social costs that are not reflected in individual decision-making.

## Core Concepts

- **Spillover Costs**: Costs that spill over to third parties
- **Unintended Consequences**: Negative consequences not intended by decision-makers
- **Social Costs**: Social costs not reflected in individual decisions
- **Market Failure**: Failure of markets to account for externalities
