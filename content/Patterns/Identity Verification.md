# Identity Verification

## Definition

**Identity Verification** refers to the process of confirming that an individual is who they claim to be, typically through the presentation and validation of credentials, documents, or biometric data, often used for security, compliance, and access control purposes.

## Core Concepts

- **Authentication**: Confirming identity through various means
- **Credential Validation**: Verifying the authenticity of presented credentials
- **Biometric Verification**: Using unique biological characteristics
- **Document Verification**: Validating official documents and credentials
