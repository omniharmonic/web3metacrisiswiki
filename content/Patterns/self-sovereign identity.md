# Self-Sovereign Identity

Self-sovereign identity represents a paradigm shift from centralized identity management to individual control over personal data and identity attributes. In the context of the [[meta-crisis]], self-sovereign identity systems can address [[Mass Surveillance]] and enable [[technological sovereignty]] while preserving [[Privacy Preservation]] and [[censorship resistance]].

## Core Principles

### Individual Control
- **[[Cryptographic Identity]]**: Unique cryptographic identifiers controlled by individuals
- **[[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)]]**: Self-controlled, globally unique identifiers
- **[[Privacy Preservation]]**: Individuals control what information to share
- **[[Selective Disclosure]]**: Sharing only necessary information for specific purposes

### Decentralized Architecture
- **[[decentralized storage networks]]**: Identity data stored across distributed networks
- **[[Content-Addressed Information Storage]]**: Immutable, verifiable identity records
- **[[cryptographic protocols]]**: Mathematical rather than institutional trust
- **[[Trustlessness]]**: Reduced dependence on centralized identity providers

### Interoperability
- **[[Cross-Platform Data Portability]]**: Identity data portable across platforms
- **[[Interoperability]]**: Identity systems that work across different networks
- **[[Standards]]**: Open standards for identity verification
- **[[Composability]]**: Identity components that can be combined and reused

## Web3 Applications

### Decentralized Identity Systems
- **[[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)]]**: Self-controlled, globally unique identifiers
- **[[Credential Verification]]**: Verification of identity attributes without revealing data
- **[[Biometric Identification and Facial Recognition]]**: Biometric verification of unique human identity
- **[[Identity Verification]]**: Cryptographic verification of identity claims

### Privacy-Preserving Systems
- **[[Privacy-Preserving Infrastructure]]**: Systems that protect user privacy
- **[[End-to-End Encrypted Communication]]**: Secure communication without intermediaries
- **[[zero knowledge proof (ZKP)]]**: Verification without revealing underlying information
- **[[Cryptographic Timestamping and Provenance Tracking]]**: Immutable records of identity events

### Governance Applications
- **[[Improved Democratic Governance via DAOs]]**: Identity-based voting systems
- **[[Quadratic Voting]]**: Democratic allocation based on verified identity
- **[[Conviction Voting]]**: Long-term commitment through verified identity
- **[[Holographic Consensus]]**: Community-driven decisions with verified participants

## Technical Implementation

### Cryptographic Foundations
- **[[Cryptographic Proof Generation]]**: Mathematical verification of identity claims
- **[[Public Key Cryptography]]**: Secure communication and asset control
- **[[Digital Signatures]]**: Unforgeable proof of authorization
- **[[Hash Functions]]**: Tamper-evident data structures

### Blockchain Integration
- **[[smart contracts]]**: Automated identity verification and management
- **[[Immutability]]**: Permanent records of identity events
- **[[Transparency]]**: Public verification of identity systems
- **[[Auditability]]**: Historical tracking of identity changes

### Economic Mechanisms
- **[[tokenization]]**: Economic incentives for identity verification
- **[[Staking]]**: Economic stake required for identity verification
- **[[Slashing]]**: Penalties for false identity claims
- **[[Reputation Systems]]**: Long-term tracking of identity behavior

## Challenges and Limitations

### Technical Challenges
- **[[oracle problem]]**: Verifying real-world identity without trusted intermediaries
- **[[scalability trilemma]]**: Security, decentralization, and scalability constraints
- **[[MEV]]**: Market manipulation in identity-dependent systems
- **[[front running]]**: Exploiting identity updates for profit

### Privacy vs. Security Trade-offs
- **[[Privacy Preservation]]**: Balancing identity verification with privacy protection
- **[[censorship resistance]]**: Avoiding centralized identity verification
- **[[decentralization]]**: Maintaining decentralized identity systems
- **[[Trustlessness]]**: Reducing dependence on trusted identity providers

### Economic Vulnerabilities
- **[[Rug Pulls]]**: Sudden withdrawal of identity verification support
- **[[MEV]]**: Market manipulation in identity-based systems
- **[[Sybil Attacks]]**: Creating fake identities to influence systems
- **[[front running]]**: Exploiting identity verification for profit

## Integration with Meta-Crisis Analysis

Self-sovereign identity addresses key components of the [[meta-crisis]]:

### Mass Surveillance
- **[[Mass Surveillance]]**: Self-sovereign identity reduces surveillance capabilities
- **[[Privacy Preservation]]**: Individuals control their own data
- **[[censorship resistance]]**: Identity systems resistant to censorship
- **[[technological sovereignty]]**: Communities controlling their own identity systems

### Epistemic Crisis
- **[[epistemic commons]]**: Shared knowledge about identity verification
- **[[Transparent Algorithms]]**: Open and auditable identity systems
- **[[Community-Based Reputation and Verification]]**: Peer-verified identity
- **[[User-Controlled Information Feeds]]**: Individuals control their information environment

### Democratic Governance
- **[[Improved Democratic Governance via DAOs]]**: Identity-based democratic participation
- **[[polycentric governance]]**: Multiple overlapping identity systems
- **[[civic renaissance]]**: Democratic participation through verified identity
- **[[technological sovereignty]]**: Communities controlling their own systems
